LETTERS OF ERASMUS

quae mihi morbum non attulerit. Nuper autem mutato domicilio ita
sum ea nouitate offensus, vt nocturnae illius febris, quae nos ante

10 biennium Orco fere demiserat, manifesta vestigia senserim: nos

contra omni cura medicorumque opibus pugnamus, vixque effugimus.
Dubia enim adhuc plane valetudine sumus. Quod si denuo ea febris

me arripuerit, actum de tuo, mi Batte, fuerit Erasm0.

Greek from John Lascaris and Erasmus,
until they went to Italy, and afterwards
from Aleander for a year. Erasmus’

to Italy in 1506, is dedicated to cop,

21. Arnoldo Eduardo] It is possible
that Erasmus has reversed the names,
and that the person here intended was
a son of Richard Arnold (fissi), the
author of the so·called Chronicle, who
was a merchant trading to Flanders
and was one of the principal inhabi-
tants of the parish of St. Magnus,
London Bridge, in which the Bridge
itself was included. The sumame
Edward does not occur in a list of
parish contributions to St. Magnus for
1494 given by Amold in the Chr-cnido
(p. 224, ed. 1811). For Rich. Arnold
see DNB, and sor this Arnold cf. i.
p. 6. Ηιι name cannot be traced in
the Inns of Court records3 which ex-
cept in the case of Lincoln’s Inn have
been lost for this period.
