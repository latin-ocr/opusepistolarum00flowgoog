490 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [¹5¹1

aduentum tuum cantabrigiam mittat. Vtinam hic esses ac emet

ea nobis fortuna vt nunquam diuelleremur‚ essentque viui, non
epistolares, inter nos sermones. Quos tandem elicui. arbitratus
(non tamen omnino, nam id nunquam potui) me prope expunctum
40 ex amicorum albo, cum inter tam crebros epistolarum tuarum
fasciculos nullam ad me vidi datam3 quod si ad nullos misisse&
tribuissem id optimis tuis occupationibus, vt tu debes meis, quod
ad neminem scripsi. Cum autem tantum videbam tibi suppedi-
tatum spacii, vt non semel ac iterum sed sepissime sarcinulas
45 litterarum, id est marsupia plena epistolarum, mitteres, existi·
mabam vel vnam me quoque accepturum, si suum in albo locum

meum nomen tenuisset; quanquam hac quoque argute occurris,
salute mihi in aliorum litteris ascripta.

Sed quid plura? Mihi satisfecisti3 si satis tibi ego sum expur-

50 gatus, supra tuam opinionem triumphabo. Vale, amice suauissime.

Tardioris meae responsionis causa est, quod serius quam putes

redditae sunt mihi abs te litterae ad 15. Cal. Decembres, quas

natali Simonis et Iudae dedisti. Iterum etiam atque etiam vale.

244⁸. Fsom JEROME Busnmnnn.

Brussels MS. 15676-7‚ p. 193. (Mechlin ⁸?)
<November 1511 2²)

[This letter is found in a manuscript volume of the Bibl. Roya le at Bruaeels
(N⁰.15676-,7 Fonds van Hulthem)‚ containing a collection of Busleiden' s poems,
speeches. and letters, and written apparently by the hand of a secretary. It is
printed by Neve, Reviasseance en Βοὶρίφιε, p. 122.

Busleiden‚ or his secretary, was indifferent to dates; and it is therefore
difficult to place this letter with precision. Ur. Nichols assigna it to June 1516,
and refers it to the endeavours which Erasmus was then making to obtain
a benefice from John le Sauvage‚ Chancellor of Burgundy. Dr. M. Reich, however,
attributes it to this period, when Erasmus was besie‘ 3ιιι3 Foxe and Ruthall

(cf. Epp. 234-250), and when his hopes were shortly to be gratified by warham
(ΕΡ. 255 introd. ς cf. Ep. 243. 17 n. ). The Moecenas whom Erasmus had served
for so many years and to whom he was daily to pay court can hardly be
Le Sauvage, for there is no evidence to show that Erasmus ever rendered him
any prolonged service. The description seems to me more fltly applied to licunt-
joy, to whom Erasmus had stood in this relation and towards whom his eyes
were turned throughout this period, than as by Dr. Reich to Warham.

The consideration which determines me to insert this letter here is the rumour
about Erasmus' death, which was in circulation at this time (ΕΡ. 251. 2 ιι.) but of
which Ι can find no trace in 1516. In the autumn of 1513 there was a widespread
repert that Erasmus was dead (cf. Ep. 270 introd.), but at that time he had
obtained his English benefice, and was not yet attempting to secure further
patronage. Dr. Reich notices a resemblance between the advice given by
Busleiden in this letter and the ‘ Praecepta aulica' which Erasmus communicatos
to Ammonius in Ep. 250.]
