576 APPENDIX Ι

in the Opus Epistolarum (H) of 1529? other passages⁶ are taken from
the Sponyia, written in J uly 1523, and the Catalofflcs Lucubrationuna
(i) composed in J anuary 1523. The resemblance to the originale is
very close, some sentences being embodied almost word for word.

The authenticity of the document has been doubted ΒΥ Dr. J. B. Kan
of Rotterdam, in various Eramiana published between 1877 and
1896; at first from internal evidence, but afterwards from suspicion
of Memla’s character. He objects that despite the quotations from
Erasmus' writings the style is not that of Erasmus; that it is not
a ‘compendium totius vitae ’; and that there is inaccuracy in the
facts ⁰. The letter to Goclen he regards as genuine; and he suppooed
at first that Merula had been imposed upon ΒΥ some one who knew
his fancy for autographa ⁷. subsequently on discovering that Merula
was suspected of having forged some new fragments which appear
in his edition of Ennius, he attributed the forgery to Merula himself.
Dr. Kan’s arguments⁸ have been dealt with by Prof. Fruin in his
Erasmiana ⁹ and by Mr. Nichols. Merula’s character¹⁰ has been vindi·
cated by Prof. P. J. Blok ¹¹ and Dr. S. P. Haak ι’.

The controversy is too long to be discussed in detail here3 hut
the consideratione of internal evidence, which seem to me to prove
conclusively the genuineness of the compendium ¹⁸, maybe recapitulated.
Mr. Nichols shows that Kan s arguments about style and incomplete·
ness are just what a forger would have anticipated and endeavoured
to meet. Only Erasmus could have ventured ιο write in a style
so unlike his own and ιο give a part when he had promised the
whole. The really decisive point is the omission of Erasmus'
brother Peter, who as “Antonius ’ plays so conspicuous a part in
the letter to Rome. This latter document was drawn up with great
care in order to obtain from Leo x a relaxation of Erasmus’ canonical
obligations, and the facts therein stated are presumably true in their
entirety; the obviously false names being substituted probably at
the time of publication. In this letter Peter, under the name of
Antonius, is mentioned frequently. The two brothers at first unite
ιο resist the attempt ιο force them into a monastery, but at length
Peter gives way3 and Erasmus, contemplating his own ineffectual
struggles ιο escape the monastic net, writes bitterly of the defection.
Of all this the only trace in the Compendium is the brief sentence:
