1512]

Tragoedias impressit nuper Ioannes Paruus, et bibliopola quidam
nostras etiam praelo nostro curauit imprimendas ad exemplarium
istud Florentinum, vtinam sic recognitum. Est tamen pergrata
mihi lucubratio tua. N am si meliuscule confidere rebus licebit, ¹5
etiam mihi cum Tragoediis tuis breui imprimam, vna cum exposi-
tiunculis nostris, saltem in Senecae.

De Adagiis autem tuis longe nobis maior spes est, et minor esset
inuidis. Nam omnes sciunt ea mihi recepta3 vbi tamen audient
necdum parata, vereor ad Aldinum exemplar propediem impressum ιο
iri. Imprimuntur autem in Alemannis, si Michael Hummelburgm
mihi vera scripsit; imprimenturque, vt me vereri dixi, hic, neque
deterrere amplius valebo. Quod. si anno superiori impressa fuissent,
iam fere distracta essent; et si modo imprimentur etiam minus
castigate, tamen melioribus lucrum praeripient. ²5

Hieronymi quoque epistolae quotquot hactenus impressae fuerunt,
diuenditae sunt; quam ob rem, quod famam disseminaui me abs
te exemplar castigatius expectare, vereor vt pom‘m impressionem
differre, vbi intelligent me nihil adbuc habere. Et reuera nullum
scio opus mihi accommodatius aut tua professione (si recte sentio) 30

many books for John Petit; see Ph.
Renouard, Imprimeurs Parium. Petit
was a Paris bookseller and stationer,
who from 1492-1530 published a great
number os books produced by various
printers. The other edition from
Badius' own press based on the Floren-
tine Traqoodiao (Ph. de Giunta‚ 3 Apr.
1506, 8⁰) is not known to Panzer. It
was perhaps merged in his edition of
1514 ; 1. ι 5 ιι.

Hummelburgus] (1487- 19 May
1527), of Ravensburg in Swabia. He
studied in Paris, where he became
BA. 1504, MA. 1505, and Proctor of
the German nation 1506 and 1511 ; and
won the friendship of Beatus Rhena-
nus. Being enthusiastic for Greek he
worked first under Hermonymus and
then under Tissard and Aleander, to
whom he was much attached. He
helped Badius in the production of
some of his books, notably in editions

of Hegesippus (1511) and Ausonius

cause. On return from Rome he made
a short stay in constance and then
settled at Ravensburg, where he worked
with untiring energy as a toacher
until his death. Though influenced
by Luther he was a staunch adherent
oi' Erasmus. There' is a sketch of his
life in the preface (BRE. 283) to his
Epimvno Grammaticus Graecae, Bas! e,
J. Herwagen,1532. See also his eorre-
spgxssdence, MHR· , BRE.; VE.; and

28. exemplar castigatius] It is clear
that the publication here projected
was independent of the Amorbach-
Froben edition of Jemme, which
was already in hand in 15¹0 (mil-2.
i. ι). Erasmus had no relations with
Froben until the misha p occurred with
the ..Μαρία in 15¹3 (cf. Epp. 269 and
283. 152 seq.) 3 but it seems that about
that time he became sware of the
Basle edition, and abandoning the
proposal with Badius, transferred his
recension of the Letters to form a part
of it.
