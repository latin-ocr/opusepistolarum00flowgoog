De duplici copia p. 2. London.
Lond. xxviii. 28: LB. i. 1. ²9 April ¹512·

[The prcface to De duplici copia verborum cc rerum commentarii abac, raris, Badius,
15 July ¹5¹²? the date is confirmed by the book. In the same volume Ep. 6⁶
was rapi-intui, addressed ιο Peter Viterlus. 'l'he Copia was a treatise designed
to καίει the beginner in Latin composition by supplying him with variety of
words and abundance of phrases. It appears first as Etouie de apio Praeceptis,
a short section attached to Angustine's copy of the Romaim-ium &aequiorum
For-mulae (p. 304). The first mention os it is in Bp. 95. 35, a May 14993 where
Erasmus speaks also of having in hand some other little treatisea⁹ one of which,
de Amplitlcationibus, forms part of the De Copia Prmopfio above mentioned. Under
the heading Comparatio ab πονηρὼ one of the specimens given is a sentence
beginning Vix maidorim . . . from a letter of Cornelius cerani ιο Trithemius
(Molhuyssn, Gom Aurelius, p. 31 , which on other grounds may probably be dated
c. April 1499, from Leiden. ‘s may be one of the ‘loci communes ’ alluded
ιο in Erasmudaccouut of the sources of the copia (Lond. i. ro, LB. εει) ; or more
probably an incorporation from the actual letter, which Erasmus may quite
well have seen circulated in manuscript.

On return from England he resumed the work (Epp. 136. 53 and 138. 162) with
the intention of dedicating it to Adelphus οἰ Burgundy‚ and it appears to have
already assumed something of its flnalshape (Ep. 145. ¹55 n.) ; but it was thrown
aside and not taken up again until Erasmus was in Italy. He mentions in
Lond. i. 10, LB. 221 one of the authors, whose work he glanced through at
Venice for the purpose of improving the eopia, probably after the Adaoiorun
chiliades (Ep. 211) had been safcly published in Sept. 1508; for when he lest.
Venice the book had not been completely copied (Epp. ειη, 3). For his work
upon it in Italy see also i. p. 34. 1—5. The eopia was one of the papers left
behind with Pace at Ferrara (p. 121), and it appears from Ep. 244. 6 seq. that
this copy never again reached Emsmus' hands. For i. p. 9. 1-4 represents the
Copia, as it was afterwards published in 1512, as a hasty composition made at
Oolet's request for St. Paul's School (Epp. 237 and 2585 cf. 241); and this

view is confirmed by the present preface.
'l'he copia was very widely reprinted (see 31:12¹) and served as a school book

in many lands. 1 have collated a great many editions but find no variations in
this preface, except a few of no importance in spelling and orden]
