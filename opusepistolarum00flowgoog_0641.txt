THE DEVENTER LETTER-BOOK 603

APPENDIX VIII

THE DEVENTER LE'PI'ER-BOOK

Tm: Athenaeum Library at Deventer contains one of the letter·
books (MS. 91) 111 which copies of Erasmus’ correspondence were made
ΒΥ his servant· -pupils. Its genuineness is indisputably established
by corrections made by Erasmus himself, which occur throughout
the volume, the first being on f. 1, the last, on f. 211. In the spring
of 1705, when Leclerc’s great edition of Erasmus’ complete works
was in progress¹, the volume came into the hands of his enterprising
publisher, Peter Vander Aa, and such of its contents as were not .
already printed were incorporated in an appendix to the volumes of
letters, which were then too far advanced to admit of reconstruction.
After being used for Leclerc’s edition, for which purpose it was
actually put into the printers’ hands, the letter-book came into the
possession of the Academia Gelro-Zutphanica at Harderwyk; and,
on the demise of that institution in 1816-7, it passed with other
literary treasure into the Deventer Library, where it now reposes.

'I'he manuscript does not appear ever to have been bound together
and, as it now stands, consiste of 228 separate folios, and a small
title· ·‚page unnumbered, on which 18 inscribed in a late xviic hand ²
within an elaborate berder, very finely drawn, ‘collectio eoequmtisszma
epistolam Desid. Erasmi Rotemdami et ad eum scriptarum, in qua
diversae Autoqraphae, nempe No. 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233,
234, 237, 239. MSS? This is followed by 224 folios numbered
consecutively at the foot of the page by some late hand. 'I'hen come
two autograph letters to Erasmus, one from Alciati (LB. App. 356),
the other from the Archduke Ferdinand (LB. 705) written ΒΥ J ames
Spiegel, which are numbered 237⁴‚238 by the same late hand. 'I'hen
a half· sheet unnumbered, containing LB. 781 m a xviio hand3 and
the last sheet 18 blank except for the number 206 which 18 part of an
older numeration.

The late numeration may with probability be assigned to John de
la Faye, who edited the manuscript for Leclerc’s edition. It cannot
be earlier than Leclerc’s edition, for the letters on f. 238 and the
half-sheet were evidently in Leclerc’s hands before he received the
letter-book, since he was able to incorporate them in the body of the
letters. And that this was complete before the Appendix letters
were dealt with is shown by the fact that the letter on f. 237, though
later in date than the two just mentioned, is placed in the Appendix.
In any case the numerationis probably not much later than Leclerc's
time.
