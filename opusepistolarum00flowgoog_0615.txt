AUTHENTICITY oF THE COMPENDIUM VITAE 5⁷⁷·

suppose that the forger of a document, which by almost verbal
transcription challenged comparison with the source from which
it was drawn ¹⁴, would have ventured to suppress one of the leading
figures of the original narrative.

On the supposition that Erasmus himself wrote the annpendium
itis easy ιο account for the disappearance of Peter. In later years
Erasmus had a very poor opinion of his brother and has nothing
good to say of him. In 1524 he was very possibly dead, and as
the letter to Rome had not yet been published, the only printed
reference ¹⁸ to connect him with Erasmus lay in Herman's Sylua
Odamm ¹⁰, published nearly thirty years before and only once
reprinted. Under these circumstances it is quite consistent with
Erasmus’ character for discreet reticence ιο suppose that he omitted
an unsatisfactory figure from the narrative on which he wished his
biography to be founded 3 a suppression which is the more pardonable,
since by so doing he could place the relations of his parents in a
better ' ht ¹⁷.

Thathlgt'rasmus should have quoted himself is not surprising. It
was his custom to keep copies of his letters; and writing probably
in haste he would quite naturally turn to a document in which
he had stated his case well and abridge it, instead of writing a new
account in concise language. The other two sources, which are
quoted more shortly, had been written not long before, and his
reglentive memory may well have recalled his own thoughts and
p ases-

The facts of Erasmus’ life as given in the Compendiwm are correct
even in small points¹⁸. The brief account of his travels also
accords well ιιι its contents and omissions with the supposition of
Erasmus' authorship. His movements in Italy, for which there
were, and are, very few records‚ are mentioned with precision. His
third visit to 'England, for which abundant material was contained
in the Fare-ayo (E) and the &astulae acl diuersos (F), is barely noticed3
and his sojourns at Basle between 1514 and 1516, of which Beatus
Rhenanus and Boniface Amol-bach, afterwards two of his litei-ary
executors, knew so much, are altogether omitted.

In the name Gerardus given to Erasmus’ father ιιι the Compendium

against its authenticity. The Papal Brief¹’ in reply ιο Erasmus'
letter to Rome is addressed ‘Dilecto filio Erasmo Rogerii Rotero·
damensi clerico Traiectensis diocesis’ ; and Kan argues with justice
that, as Vischer points out, this must be the real name of Erasmus’
parent. Fruin, in defence of the Οοηῳεπάἱιιηι, suggests an error on
the part of the papal scribe, J ames Sadolet, afterwards Bishop of
