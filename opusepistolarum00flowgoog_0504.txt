ministro ac discipule Grocini, qui nunc Parisiis dat operam bonis

literis. quenis est bonae spei et in quem recte beneficium collo·

[The year-date is established by the Pope's illness. The mouth-date given by

ERASMVS AMMONIO SVO S. D.

Brs nos exhilaras, Andrea saeuissime, dum vino iucundissimo
literas addis multo iucundiores, planeque tuum ingenium tuosque
mores resipientes, quibus mea quidem sententia nec fuit vnquam,
nec erit, quicquam mellitius. Quare duplici nomine tibi gratias

5 agimus. De pecuniae mentione quod succenses, equidem 11011
ignorabam animum tuum regia fortuna dignum, verum existimabam
te missurum vtrem maiusculum in menses aliquot duraturum;
quanquam hic quoque maior erat quam vt ab homine modesto
gratis accipi possit.

More dem veniam tam seriis occupato negociis. Demiror te sic
perpetuo nidum premere nec vsquam euolare. Hanc Academiam
si quando libeat reuisere, multis gratissimus veneris, mihi in primis.
Quod iubes me isthuc redire, si perduret languor, nihil video quod

15 mihi blandiatur Londini praeter duorum aut trium amicorum
consuetudinem3 verum his de rebus alias. Audio Iulium maxi·
mum vita defunctum.
