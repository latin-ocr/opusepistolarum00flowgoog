259. Fssom JOHN Binum.

Deventer MS. 91, f0. 176.
LB. App. 391.

Oxford.
12 April (1512 2).

[The date of this letter cannot be determined with precision. The University
Register, G. f. 207 ν’, shows that Babham supplicated for his B. A. on 28 Jan.
1512,after having been· ιιι residence two years and a term; and that on 14 March
¹512 (f. 218 ν’) his disputations were curtailed to enable him to return home,
because of sickness ιιι his house. He was in residence again on 29 NoV.1515
(f. 270 v⁶); but otherwise nothing is known ol him, and his name does not occur
elsewhere ιιι Erasmus correspondence.

As Babham was probably not more than eighteen when he took his degree,
the letter can hardly be placed earlier than 151⁹ss a late date is improbable,
since after the publication of the New Testament in 1516 the obscure Babham
would probably have addressed Erasmus with much greater reverence.

The words Tanta. .tua suit semper humanitas imply previous acquaintance.
1 suggest therefore that Babham had met Erasmus somewhere in England,
perhaps in Lord Mountjoy' s household; and that when he entered upon his
studies at Oxford Brast wrote him a letter of encouragement, asking him at
the same time to render him some service there ]

IOANNES BABHAMVS ERASMO 8. Ι).

stn'rvu voluptatis mihi attulerint tuae litterae, Erasme doctis-
sime, facilius fuerit tibi coniectari quam mihi fando consequi, non
tam quod iam mihi tempus obtigerit, in quo possem voluntati tuae
obsequi, quam quod mecum habeo litteras Erasmi quas iterum

14. Franciscus] Berckman (We1·ck-conuooaaeimae,.1mw Μ. D. xi, London,
man Y), a native of cologne, who was R. ιι, aa. The Convocation was
in businessas a bookseller at Antwerp. held on 6 Feb. 1513 (wilkins, Coneil.
He acted as an agent for printers (Ep. iii. 652), and, as Erasmus was then* ιιι
264. 9) and was in England about this London, he was probably present. The

time (Ep. ⁹⁶3- 46, 7). It was through
him that the revised edition of the
,mavia destined for Badius (Ep. 263)
passed into Froben's hands (Ep.283. 155) ;
and Erasmus had many unpleasant
relations with him throughout his
life. He seems now to have wished to
procure the Copia, perhaps on the same
pretext of transmission to Badius.
dominus Ioannes] Probably Six-
tin, who is spoken of in this way in
Ep. 291. a. De la 1·''aye s meaningless
conjecture was caused by the unusual
abbreviation for dominus and by the
correction Ioannis into Ioannes.
15. oratio] Oratio habita a D. Ioanne
Gom, Doeavw sancti Pauli, ad aarum in

oration cannot have been long in
printing, for it filla only twenty-one
octavo pageS.

17. carminum] The Camino Saldania,
written for St. Paul's School, had
already appeared in R. Caesar's edition
of the Goncn‘o de puero Iesu (Ep. 175).
They were reprinted by Badius in the
Copia together with the Expoomzatio Iesu.
Colet may have been unaware of
Caesar' s publication, or perhaps Eras-
mus was now engaged on the Cato or
the Instinctam hominis Christiani pub-

lished with it (Ep. 298).
18. alteram partem]'lhe second book,

De rerum copia, the first being De copia
verborum.
