Erasmus' aim in coming ιο Paris was to obtain a Doctor's degree in Theology
(Ep. 48), and for that purpose he entered the College of Montaigu‚ which under
Standonck (p. 200) was now once more flourishing. Of his life there in the
Dmnus Paumm not much is known. In ii. 103-5 110 speaks bitterly of the hard-
ships he endured3 and the picture is vividly amplified in the Ichthyopaaqia
(LB. i. 806 11-807 ος cf. ibid. 632 Α). During his residence Erasmus delivered
some sermons ‘de laudibus diuorum ' (Luc. Ind. 3 cf. i. p. 37. 15, 6), and Boece in
his letter os 1528 (p. 155) speaks of his lecturing on ‘sacros codices-³ A tradition
about him is preserved in the life of Emile Fournier, the Orientalist (1683-1745),
who when turned out 111 1118 youth from his Paris semiantro retired to the
College of Montaigu. The room allotted to him there was believed to have been

Robert Gaguin (1433-22 May 1501), born at Calonne on the Lys in Artois, was
a Fleming by birth, but French by nationality. He was educated in a monastic
school belonging to the Trinitarian or Maturin order, which he joined, and of
which in 1473 he became General. In 1457 he was sent to study in PariS, but
the business of his order, which concerned itself with the redemption of
prisonem of war, interrupted his studies and he did not become Dr. of Canon
Law until 1480. He was sent 011 missions to Italy, Germany and Spain in
1465-6‚ to Spain in 1468, and in 1471-2 to Rome: and 1118 successful diplomacy
led to his employment as royal ambassador to Gen-many in 1477 and 1492, to
Italy in 1484 and 1486, and ιο England in 1489-90. His interest in learning was
great, and in 1470 he took a leading part in the introduction of printing into
Paris. In 1483, and often later. he was Dean of the Faculty οἱ Canon Law
in the University. His Latin works include Do arte πιεὺνυῖιαηαί, 14733 a poem
(1488), and a treatise (1490), de Pan-itate Conceptionim de origine et yestis Francorum
Compendium, 1495 (cf. Ep. 45) ; and Epistola et Orationes, 1498. He also wrote much
in French, and translated Caesar (1485) and the third decade of Livy (1493).

80111818 ad me longa, Herasme, epistola ob id precipue, vt michi
aliqua te beniuolentia insinues, atque 01118 rei causa preludio quodam
agis, quasia me difficile impetraturus sis quod videris expectare ; itaque
ad patrocinium tibi assumis copiam superexundantem laudum. Quas

5 si de me recte predices, ipse iudices3 non, si quidem ita gnarus sum,
vt quid desit quam quid michi assit magis intelligam. Nam quod
proxime sibi quisque habitat sibique maxime carus est, nemo se satis
considerat. Quesiui, fateor, diligenter litteras et doctrinam, sed non
comparaui, similis non satis consulti institoris qui per nundinas

10 circumlatus, postquam multas merces est contemplatus, nullas tandem
pecunie inops domum vehit. Et que mea inculta lectitasse te per
voluptatem opera dicis, talia esse arbitror quales precoces et nondum
satis maturos fructus, quos in mercatum proferri vides, qui leuandi
