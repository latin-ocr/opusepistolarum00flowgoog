Concio de puero Iesu < 1511 9) Τ11. v0. Louvain.
(September 1503.)

[This letter 10 printed for the first time in Desideria· Erasmi &mama minaeque
linquae doctissimi concio de puero Iesu α puero in adcola Goletiea nuper Londini inuitum
“ pronuncianda, a rare volume of which there are copies in the Britiah Muzeum,
the Univereity Library-at Ghent, and the Imperial Library at Vienna. It hae 110
printer'e name. but M. Vanden Berghe identifiee the type and printer'e mark
with those used by Robert Caesar, the latter containing the arme of the city of
Ghent and a verae referring to ite reputed foundation byJuliue Caesar. The

η pueri Iesu posita in ludo litterario quem nuper instituit Odetue, a'nd the Epitaphium
scut-ulae temulenti referred to in ΕΡ. 016. Aa the building of St. Poura School
was only completed in 1510 (R. B. Gardiner, Admission reyisters qt St. Pana’e scheol,
p. 7), 1110 concio was certainly not composed until that year, and probably not
until 1511 ς ao that the volume may probably be dated 1 Sept. 1511. 11 cannot
be placed later, since it 10 referred to in ΕΡ. 063. 9, 10, and was reprinted by
8011111·οιρ at· Stmeburg in July 1510. It 10 noticeable that in the earne volume
-- Schiirer printed the ⁴ pirate ' edition or theDo ratione cmii, which had afterwards
⁸¹ to be withdrawn‚ cf. ΕΡ. 66. In all later editions of the concio, from Sohurer’a
of August 1514 onwarde', 11110 101101· 10 000001· 10 omitted. ν

The date 10 fixed almost conclusively by the worda noem diuque paro macedam
'in Principie aduentum, which may be taken to refer to the Panegyric prepared for
the Archduke Philip, cf. Epp. 176 and 178-80. In support of this date may be
noted the resemblance between 11. 4, 5, and Ep. 178. 35-7. The only other year
which could be assigned ia 1509, when Erasmus passed through Louvain

κ , (Ep. 066) ; but nothing 10 known of that occasion, and 1 am not aware of any
‚visit from Prince Oharlee for which Erasmus could have been preparing.

The composition of the volume printed by Caesar 10 therefore difficult to
‘account for. Erasmue' letter plainly cannot be a preface to the Ouo-cie as it
eunde, though it ia poaible that it accompanied an early draft of the concio,
written for the school over which Caesar then presided; for such wediting cf.
the Paraphrase on Valla (p. 108), the De conscribendis epistolis (ΕΡ. 71), and the

- Do copia (ΕΡ. 060). More probably it may be supposed that 000001· obtained the

· · Concio and the poema from Erasmus in Paris, with which he then had con·
nexione, in the summer of 1511, and that 111 reprinting them he added, th
unconnected a letter written to himself 001110 yeara before, which he had doubt—
le'a'e treaeured. ’Τ1110 view 10 au ported by the fact that the volume of verae by
Ammonius which Erasmus too with him to Paria 111 1511, cf. Ep. 018, contains
poema on the eameaubjecte: Ad Comum . . . de schola quam pua-2⁶³ mvsa-cmii, and
Invitat pueros ad supradictam scholam, in qua carim· pueri docentis imavo locata eet.

Robert de Keysere (Caesar) of 0110111 was probably a connexion of the
Peter Caesar, 1110 follow-citizen, who printed at Ghent about 11110 time. He
waa a versatile percon and paneed readily stom one employment to another.
In 1503 he was evidently a schoolmaeter at Ghent. subsequently he took
to printing, and after the present volume, which wan probably reduced 111
