[Τ1110 and Epp. 917, 993, 951, 957 010 brief abstracte or notes of letters from
Bombasius to Erasmus, preserved in Fantuzzi's Νυκτέα dealt· senum Bolum-aa· (1789).
When Fantuzzi wrote, a considerable number of original letters by Bombasius
were in the possession of a Sig. Giacomo Biancani; but the collection, which
Fantuzzi unhappily could not afford space to print, has since been dispersed,
and only one of the letters, to Aldus, is now known to survive, in the Biblio-
theque Nationale (Nouv. acq. Lat. 1554, P 18).

Erasmus made during his stay in that town, and to whom 110 became closely
attached. In 1509 he delivered an oration to Louis 1111 111 1110 name of the

Poetry, and till 1511 also in Greek, in his native city. In 1513 he went to
Naples, and thence to Rome, where he became secretaryto cardinal Pucci. In
August 15¹7 he accompanied Pucci, who was sent as Nuncio to Switzerland, and

[As a result of the connexion established with Aldus through the printing of
1110 Euripides (Epp. 207 and 209) Erasmus went 1ο Venice and saw the new
edition of the Aaaqia through the prees ς living under Aldus' 1001· 011 intimate
1011110 with the members of the Academy‚ and writing continually to enlarge the
book, whilst the printing was going on (cf. Adam. 1001 and 9001). The character
of the work was entirely changed. Prossting by Gaguin's criticism (Lond. i. 19,
LB. 900) Erasmus had made preparatione for a considerable enlm-gement,
before coming to Italy (Lond. xvii. 3, LB. 609). Ηο was determined that
it should no longer be jejune, and allowed himself a free hand in writing
his commenta, which on congenial topics were expanded into essays. From
838 adages (cf. introd. to Epp. 195, 6) 1110 book grew to 3,960; and its title was
changed from collectanea to maiades.

This letter 10 printed on the last of twelve pages which are prefixed to the
book, and contain the Iudex secundum materias. Plainly, therefore, it was written
when the book was nearing completion, and its date may be taken from the
colophon, Sept. 1508 (α). The preface is corrected in Froben's edition of 1517-8 (Β).
