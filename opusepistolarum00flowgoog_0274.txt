· rediturus ⁴? Mihi quidem, quanquam hic omnia durissima videntur,
5 stat tamen sententia omne taedium amore tui deuorare, omnem ex·
orbere molestiam; ne cum tu in amando constantissimum te prae-
stiteris, ego vicissim 111 obsequendo parum constans fuisse videar.
Tu fac eum ad nos animum adfer-ae, ne vel tu sine 001100 consuetudinem
onris neglexisse, vel ego frustra tantum taediorum pertulisse credar.

01111 00101 (1466 ?-16 Sept. 1519), one of the leniore of the revival of learning
in England‚ from this time onwards a close friend of Erasmus. He had returned
from Italy to Oxford 0. 1496 and 10 said to have settled 111 Magdalen College.
The University Registers unhappily are missing from 1471-1505, and therefore
give no assistance in traeing his University career. In 1504 he was appointed
Deanlof St. Paul's and used the resources thus obtained to found St. Paul’s
001100 111 1510.

See lives of him by Erasmus (Loud. xv, 14: LB. 435) 3 by S. Knight, 1724; by
J. Η. Luptou, 1887 ; and DNB. There is an excellent estimate of his work in
F. Seebohm's Oxt'ord Resormen (3rd edit. 1887).]

IOANNES COLE'rvs ERASMO SVO S. D.

anxvs meus, Erasme, in epistola sua te mihi valde commendat·
commendauit te mihi antea tum fama tui nomime, tum quorundam
scriptorum tuorum testimonium. Parthisiis quando eram, Erasmus
111 ore doctorum non erat incelebris, Epistola quaedam tua ad
5 Gaguinum scripta, in qua illius operam et artem in Gallica historia
admirariS, a me lecta, erat mihi quasi specimen quoddam et degustatio
perfecti hominis et magnae literaturae et multarum rerum scientiae.

born by the second marriage, making

sible palaeographically, because Groein
allowance for the customary year's

was in London at this time (000 his

‘doole,' which nr. Niehols thinks
probable (ibid. pp. 169, 70). By his
second wife Say had another daughter
Mary, who married Hem-y Bourchier,
Earl of Essex. There is nothing to
show whether she or Elizabeth was
the elder, except that Essex was the
elder bridegroom when the two
daughters were married, both at the
same time, 0. Easter 1497 (ibid. pp. ¹75»
176). 1f Elizabeth was the younger,
she may well have been too young to
be given at once to her husband. Cf.
Ep. 79 inti-od.

Erasmus an introduction to Colet-
Ε, which was printed in Erasmus·
absence, has several obvious misprints,
e.g. LudolphO, Ep. 94, Α111111110101101110,
Ep. 30¹· Evidence of the want of
super-vision in these volumen is given
by the perpetuation ol ‘Clyston' (Ep.
194) in all editione after E.
