frightened away

again very quickly by a fresh outbreak of the disease. He next thought of going

to Cologne, but there the ravage·

pestilenee were as great as in Paris (Ep.

- 172. 6 ιι.), and he therefore betook himselfto Louvain. ]

St mihi vera nunciantur, videris non nihil offensus nostra epistola,
fortasse, quanquam esset verissima, tamen quia liberius scripta quam
oportebat. Verum hoc vel iusto dolori meo tua humanitas debebat
ascribere ; vel quia in epistola, cui semper arcani fides debetur, licet
5 interdum liberius agere. Nam qui talia verba in me effudit vel
euomuit potius, quid ego dignum stomachari queam ⁶? Contemnunt
me istic nescio qui plane stolidi et indocti, qui pietatem vniuersam
in cucullo et tristitia sitam esse putant3 nihil facilius quam aliena

contemnere, nihil etiam stolidiuS.

commendatione spontanea domini Adriani de Traiecto, huius loci
Decani. Quam conditionem ego certis de causis refutaui, quarum
haec vna est, quod tam prope absum ab Hellandicis linguis, quae

[This and Ep. 171 seem to announce a first visit to Louvain. The Abp. of
Besancon died on 27 Aug. 1502 (p. 364); but the date of Batt' s death is unknown.
It was prior to Ep. 170, but the year-date of that is supplied from here. The
order ιιι which they are mentioned here suggests that the Abp! s death was the

later.

Also the words Ιιοο anno (1. 1) are more probably to be referred to a

definite year, which is therefore 1500, than to a year's time.
As Erasmus was definitely at Louvain in Feb.1503 (Ep. 173), these letters
may be placed in the preceding autumn. The fact that Heni-y οἱ Ber-gen
