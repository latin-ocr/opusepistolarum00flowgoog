The business for which Erasmus went to Paris was clearly the publication of the

disertis (ἕρ. 999). 11 appears from Ep. 991 that this letter did not reach its
es 1116 ion.

In the remarkable absence of all trace of Erasmus between his journey back
from Italy in 1509 (Ep. 916 introd.) and this visit 10 Paris 111 1511, 1116 move·
ments can only be a matter of conjecture. For some part of the time he was
probably with Lord Mountjoy (cf. Ep. 959. 19 11.); but the period before this
journey had evidently been spent in Londom where he had been living with
Ammonius (Ep. 991. 98) 111 Μο16’6 1101166 111 Bucklersbury (l. 19 and Ep. 939. 3).

Andrew Amm0nius (de Harena) of Lucca (0. 1478-17 or 18 Aug. 1517) was one
of Erasmus’ most intimate friends ; an Italian, who had come 10 England from
Rome to seek his fortune. Ep. 943. 95-39 implies that he had known the members
of the Rovere family there mentioned at a time when their foi-tunes were not
in the ascendant, and 1116161016 before the election of Julius 11 to the Papacy
(1 N ov. 1503). Β111 1116 departure from Rome is probably to be laced in the
autumn of 1504 ς when his fellow-townsman Sylvester dei Gigli o Laeca, Bp. of
Worcester, whom he mentions as 1116 patron (Lond. ii. 7, LB. 936), 1166 66111 10
carry the Papal cap and sword to Henry vn (cf. Creighton, Hister-icat Εεοανε,
pp. 911, 9; and Gairdner, Memorials os Henry VII, p. 86). He was already in
England in 1506, 611106 116 knew Erasmus before the latter's Journey to Italy
(Ep. 983). 111 1509 116 1166 111 Lord Mountjoy's service (Epp. 983 and 915);
being 111 Ρ606·6 judgement (De Fracta, p. 73) 1116 most accomplished Latin seoretary
of 1116 day. In 1511 116 published in Paris a small volume of verse, of which
only one copy 16 known to exist, in 1116 Bibl. Nationale at Paris (Res. m.
Yc. 660), 61111 11161 perhaps incomplete (l. 6 11. ). It was dedicated 10 Mountjoy
(Ep. 990), 10 whom the opening verses are addressed 3 and contains besides these
and the Eclogue (l. 19) poems on the accession of Henry vm and his marriage,
and others addresoed 10 Foxe (⁴) and Ruthall (9). Τ11616 is also 6 sapphic ode
on Henry v1; epigrams on Peter Griphus (ΕΡ. 943. 60 11.), Ant. Bouhier, Abbot of
Fecamp, 0116 of the French ambassadors who signed a treaty of peace in London 011
93 Kar. 1501} (Rymer‚ xiii. 970), Iouis Harlian, physician to the 111-0111111116 Philip,
Celet and his 6011001 (p. 949), and Erasmus. By July 1511 he had entered the
King's service as Latin Secretary3 and on 3 Feb. 1519 received a Canonry in
St. Stephen's,Westminster. He was naturalized on 19 Apr. 1514 3 and in March
1515 obtained throuffh Henry's influence with the Pope a subcollectorship of
Peter's Pence in Eng and. He died of the sweating sickness, aged rather less
111611 forty (Lond. xxiii. 5, LB. 671). See Brewer, and Knight, Life qs 00161, p. 2¹33

Ammonius’ book in the British Museum 3 but 1 0611 find 110 trace of it]
