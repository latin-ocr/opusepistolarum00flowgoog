[The letter that follows has a curious history. It was printed first, in 11ιο
form in which it stands here, in Aucustim' Dathi Smensis. ‚Epistulam Praeterea

vestis, Paris, Geo. Biermantius Brugensis expensis Iohannis Geranion, in praelo
Gaee’areo, 20 001. 1511, as 1110 preface to the latter article (01); and this was
reprinted by Schure⁵r 01 strasburg (cf. Ep. 175) 10 July 1510 (α’). 011 15 July

Vitorius takes the place of Τ11010’,0 and that ‘mi Leucophaee' has become

‘mi Petre' (β). Τ1110 version was reprinted by Schurer‘ 10 August 1513 (γ) and
August 1514 (δ), 1110 title-page of the later edition being inscribed Do ratione
audii. Λα rocoa-»titione ardor-is dum mense Auen-sto Aruenlinae defferet, HDXIIII.

'I'he explanation seems to be 11101 11110 11001100 was originally composed for
Thomas Grey, that it was among the papers which passed 1010 the hands of
Thale 01 Fen-ara (cs. Ep.3o. 16 11. ); and that Thale surreptitiously published it,
00 though it were written to himself, but had 001 sufficient Greek to detect 1110
0131111100οω of ‘ Leucophaee. ' When Erasmus discovered the fraud, 110 01 0000
republished it with a prefaoe 10 Ρο101· Viterius, 0 close friend of Grey; and on
passing through Strasburg 1n 1514110 arranged for a new edition of the authorized
version with its gustantes displayed on the title-page.

11 follows then that 11110 11001100 was written before Erasmus· return from
1ta15.11 the date and place assigned by a are to be retained the letter must be
attributed to 1506, 1110 only year before the Italian journey in which Erasmus
was in England on March 15. There is no evidence to show whether Erasmus
was then in communication with 01·ογ 01· 001, but the fact that both Luc. Ina.
and i. describe the De Ratione Stadii 00 written for Peter Viterius, ‘quod is in·
3001100 aliquot bonaeque spei adulescentulos erudiendos haberet· (i. p. 9. 6-9),
suggests that Viterius may have succeeded Erasmus 00 tutor to 01ογ (Ep. 58,
imma), and that 1110 11001100 was written in Paris. In this case the date and
place, which are removed 10 β, 101101 have been added by Thale 10 impart an
air 01 reality. It may be noted that Ep. 56 0100 treats ‘ de ratione studii.'

Peter vitet-ius (Y Vitre) was 0 Frenchman of humble origin, who both now and
in 1516-8 was in close relation 10 Thomas Grey. Before 1516 he wasteaching in
Calain but for some reason he was ejected‚ and at Erasmus· suggestion returned
