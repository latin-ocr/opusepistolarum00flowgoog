arrival of a messenger from Batt, with a

parcel ot Erasmus' papea which had

been left behind ς cf. Epp. 123. 1 and ¹24· By tbe same messenger, who appears
to have been very talkative‚ Erasmus sent back this letter, together with part of
his Paraphrase on Valla's &matina (p. 108), and a bundle of letters for Batt to
forward to England, including ope for Edward Arnold.]

7. Anglica fata] Erasmus had with
him cao, which he repreoents himself
as having brought from Franco. But a
law of Edward 111 sorbade the exporta-
tion of gold and silver from England‚
and this had been re·enacted by
fleury vn (4' Hen. vn. c. 23), with
express statement that no exception
was made sor foreign coinage. More
and Mountjoy seem to have been un-
sware of this, when they advised Eras-
mus that he could safely take his money
out, it it· were not in English coin.
At the cuntem-house at Dover all but
ιο (six angels) ‘was taken from him,
and his hopes of returning to Paris
to study in affluence were rudely
shattered ς an injury which he resented
for the rest o( his life. It appears
that the money was confiscated, for

no. diuo Iuliano] This place, which
Mr. Nichols is unable to identify, is
perhaps Iuliacum (J uilly) between
Dammartin and Meaux, which is about
the requisito distance from Paris, with
a river running between, and had an
Augustinian abbey. It lies, however,
somewhat off the direct route from
clermont to Paris. Erasmus was
familiar with the place (l. 96), prob·
ably from his journey to Tournehem
in 1499 (Epp. 87-9); 1. 1⁴ also shows
acquaintance with the route.
