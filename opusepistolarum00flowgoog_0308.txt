119. To JAMES Bur.

Farrago p. 258. (Paris.)
F. p. 378: HN: Lond. ix. 14: LB. 81. <February 1500.)

[This and Ep. 128 form one letter in all editions ; but the two parts are so
widely distinct that 1 have taken the extreme step of severing them, at the point
which seems most suitable. Mr. Nichols retains them in one, and holds that
this was elaborately composed from a number of previously written lowen for
insertion in a letter-book. The numerous corrections made in later editions
and the clumsy structure of the narrative, which plunges at once (l. 20) into
an account of the second day's journey and then reverta in a parenthesis (l. 59)
ιο the first, seem to denote hasty composition ; and Ι therefore suppose that two
letters have been joined together through a mistake of the editors. LB. App.
296faffords an example of such a mistake, which has arinen from the loss of a
lea of a letter-book.

The year-date assigned is unquestionable, because of the Anatim sata and the
complete accord of the mouth-dates here given. Also Ep. 14 . 59 states that
Erasmus was threatened by robbers on his journey to Paris. is course is as
follows. On 27 Jan. he was at Dover (Ep. 145), whence he crossed to Boulogne
(LB. i. 378 s). He went then to Tournehem‚ and after spending two nights
with Batt (Ep. 120) set out for Paris. He reached Amiens in the asternoon of
31 Jan., started on with horsea the same evening‚ and slept at an unnamed
village (1. 73). On 1 Feb. he passed to the west of Clermont and slept at
J uilly (ἲ), reaching St. Denis and Paris on 2 Feb.

This letter was not written immediately, since it alludes in ll. 1-6 to the

29. Anno mccccxcvn. add. H.

in 1504 became Dean of St. Paul’s. In
1506 his old pupil and patron,Warham,
appointed him Master of All Hallows,
Maidstone ; where he died.

See Prof. Burrows in OHS. colloc-
tanea, 11.‚ and DNB. which in some
points is incorrect.

23. Linacri] Thoe. Linacre, c. 1460-
90 Oct. 1524. Fellow of All Souls
Collega, Oxford, 1484. From 1485 ιο
1499 (see ΕΗΒ. xviii. 514) 110 was in
Italy, where in 1492 he graduated Ma).
at Padus, and afterwards spent some
years in Venice, assisting in the Aldine
edition of Aristotle. On his return ιο
England he settled in London, and
endeavoured without success to cust
Bernard Andreas from his position as
tutor to Prince Arthur. He continued
in London, working at medicine and
Latin3 and in 1509 was appointed
physician to Henry vm. In 1512 110
wrote a Latin grammar, for St. Paul's

School, which, though rejected by Celet,
iu an improved form enjoyed a high
reputation throughout Europe as late
as the end-os the century. He is mors
famous for a series of translations of
Galen, published between 1517 and
1524, which placed him with cop
(Ep. 124) among the first physicians
of Northern Europe. In 1518 110 took
a leading part in founding the college
of Physicians. See alife by J. N, John·
son ; Prot. Burrows, op. cca, and DN B.

When this letter was written, Lin-
acre's translation of Procius' Sphere
in Aldus' Astnmomici Veteres, Oct. fin.
1499, had probably reached England
and may have been in Erasmus’ hands.

25. reliquum catalogum] Wm. Lati·
mer, see Ep. 206, whose name is some-
times mentioned among the friends
made by Erasmus during this visit,
was in Italy at this time. See BER.
xviii. 514.
