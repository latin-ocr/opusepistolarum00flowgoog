LE'H'ERS OF ERASMUS

Gerson adeo auellat, ita vt nec ad historias nec ad Decreta ponti-

ficum nec ad conciones, sed neque ad orandum scriptisque aut ore
persuadendum idonei satis esse videantur. Et cum maxime opus

bendarum, regiminis animae, et ad causas in generalibus conciliis
pertractandas, eorum opera nemo foeliciter vti possit.

Liceat eis et expediat questiones legere, concertare, argutias medi-

atque decet antiqua et summa religionis nostrae lumina nequaquam

Gellius libri noni capite vicesimo seeundo, ex Platonis Gorgia longam
et elegantem sententiam citans. Sic et noster Icolampadius nobis

loquacitatem et (vt Gerson ait) ad chymerinam mathematicam redi-

creberrime proferunt, ex lege, ex prophetis, ex Euangelio et Aposto-
lis adducunt nihil, fragilemque harundinem pro defensandis dictis

fidere possent, vagina reconditum seruant. Ille idem Icolampadius

Reformation at Basle. Educated first
at Heilbronn, he went for a short
while to read law at Bologna 3 but
returned in Oct. 1499 to the more
congenial study of theology at Heidel-
berg, where he fell under the influence

near Wiirzburg (1482—-24 ,

of wimpfeling, and became ΜΛ. Oct.
1503. After a short stay aa tutor at
the court of the Pfalzgraf Philip, he
returned to his home, as a parish
priest3 some of his sermons preached
there were edited by Zasius at Freiburg
in 1512. In 1513 he matriculated at
Tssbingen as Icelumbadius and read
Greek with Melanchthon 3 and then re·
turned to study I-Iebrew at Heidelberg,
where he formed a close friendship
with Capito. 1515-8 he spent mainly
in Basle at the invitation of the Bp.,
Christoplier von Utenheim, and helped
Erasmus with the Hebrew of the
Nouum Ivi-strumentum, at the end of
which a commendatory letter by him
is inserted. From 1518 to 1520 he
was at Augsburg; in 1520 he sought
shelter from the Reformation in a
monastery, but emerged in 1522 to
take part in the strugg e, and returned
to Basle where the remainder of his
life was spent. In later years he
adopted the form Oecolampadius as
his name. There is a contemporary
life by Capito; and see ADB.
