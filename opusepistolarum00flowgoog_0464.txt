[Thep reface to lphiqmm in the volume of Sept. 1506 (Ep.188).·1·h0 play
was translated in England (i. p. 5), and this preface was probably composed in
haste during the printing; since it was withdrawn in favour of one addressed

to warham (Ep. 208) in the Aldine volume of Dec. 1507. ]
EBASMVS LECTORI 8. P. D.

Qvoman intelligebamus aliis alia placere, quo cunctis (quoad fieri
posset) faceremus satis, simulque ipsi nihil non experiremur, in hac
tragoedia vertenda nonnihil de pristina illa religione remisimus,
pauloque maiorem habuimus rationem candoris et perspicuitatis.

5 Praeterea in choris immodicam metrorum variationem tempera·
uimus, non nostris consulentes commodis, sed partim quod videremus
tantam generum confusionem ab oratione soluta non multum abesse,
partim quod intelligeremus et Senecam tragicum ab eius rei imita·
tione abstinuisse. Vale, lector optime.

[The preface to Amandu- scu mamantis ιιι Luciam· opusc-«14 15063see Ep. 187,
where a list of editions· is given. It occupies about a third of f. 9, the remainder

bein left blank, and the Pseudomantia beginning on the vers03 an arrangement
whic indicates that the translation was brought to Paris ready, and was printed
before Erasmus determined to whom it should be dedicated. The hurried
character of the composition is also shown by the numerous emendations made
in β. The reference to the catastrophe at Chartres enables the letter to be dated

with some recuion.

time almost monopolized the ecclesiastical preferment of the diocese of chartres,
holding the Bishop ric consecutively for fifty years, the Deanery for one hundred,
