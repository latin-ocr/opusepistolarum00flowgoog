THE LETTERS 'ro SERVATIUS, FRANGIS, ΛΝΒ SAsBom)

I'r is not clear whether these letters are to be regarded as genuine
documents or whether they are merely epistolary exercises on simple
themes, such as those exhibited in the De Con-scribendis Epistolis ¹,
interchanged between Erasmus and his friends for the sake of
practice in Latin composition. The latter interpretation is the
easier, but if they are taken as genuine, they may be divided into
two groups. The first, Epp. 4—9, shows Erasmus under the influence
. of a sentimental affection for Servatius, and pining for his society,
which the regulations of ‘the monastery-made itdifficult for him to

life devoted himself to study and to the advancement of good learn-
ing. But there is a considerable resemblance in tone between these
letters and those to Grey at a later period (Epp. 58 etc.), and afurther
reason for regarding them as genuine may be found in Erasmus’ admisj
sion made in later life of certain early indiscretione, ‘ voluptatibus, οἱδὶ
quondam fui inclinatus, nunquam seruiui ' 3 the intention of ⁴ volup·
tates ’ being made plain by the subsequent statement, ‘ crapulam qt
ebrietatem semper horrui fugique ².’ It may be noticed that thls
admission was made in a letter to Servatius, from whom under tho
circumstances concealment would be impossible ; that the letter ΨΒ
never published by Erasmus; and that when it appeared in pnqt
a few years before his death, he endeavoured to disown it ⁸. There 18
