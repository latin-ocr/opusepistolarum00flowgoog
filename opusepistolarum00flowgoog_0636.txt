doubt. The correspondence of Cornelius Gerard in No, 1323 men-
tions a number of small points ⁸' alluded to in the collection
published by Merula, and also supplies the exact complement to a
statement in one of the letters⁸⁸3 but as these are altogether too
petty to allow of the supposition that Merula had seen the Gouda
manuscripts and made use of some of their contenta, the whole hypo-
thesis of forgery falls to the ground.

The contenis of Οι may therefore be accepted as genuine. The
fact that the collecfion made by Francis was not publisbed by
Erasmus may readily be attributed to disappointment at finding
them inferior in style and contenta to his expectation. The two
letters of this period published in E were perhaps selected from it
as the only ones which, doubtless by revision, could be made worthy
of Erasmus’ reputation.

Scriverius’ reprint of Merula’s book (θ’) contains thirty-four out of
the forty-two letters in Book 1, and adds to them a number of others,
most of which are letters to and from Pirckheimer. These are very
possibly derived from the recently published volume of Pirckheimer’s
works (P): but as Seriverius omits some of those printed by Goldast
and adds a new one addressed to Pirckheimer, it is possible that ins
collection came from another source. He has also three new letters,
addressed to John de Hondt.

The Epistozae Familiares (Q) were discovered in 1773 by the Bishop
of Basle in the records belonging to the Chapter, and deposited in the
University Library, where they are now. They were edited a few
years later by some one who conceals his name, but who was pro·
bably an official of the Library. The letters are all addressed to
Bonifaee Amerbach, and with two exceptions‚ one of 1515 and tho
other of 1522, belong to the period of Erasmus’ sojourn in Freiburg,
1 29- .

Dutch bookseller resident in England, whose name appears on the
