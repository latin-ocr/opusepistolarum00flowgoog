D. Lamum, virum omnium quos in Anglia nouerim humanissimum

quod ambo nolimus. Bene vale, Ammoni.

[This is the preface to a translation of Plutarch' s Ba emitote capienda a ιιιιικὲαῑε,
which exista in manuscrit in the University Library at Basle. The translation
forms a neatly bound booz of twenty -flve small quarto leaves, the first of which
is occupied by the preface. At the foot of the first page is written in the hand
of Bonisace Amerbach (Ep. 326)· manus domini Erasmi Roterodami:

The translation was perhaps first made in the autumn of 1512 (cf. Ep. 264),
and shared the fate of Ep. 979 which was committed to Berckman. It may be
conjectured that Erasmus subsequently, on finding that the Plutarch was not
yet published‚ wrote a special cop for presentation to Wolsey, as a Now Year
offering’ ιιι 15143 and that having {tiled to present it in time (Ep. 987. 9-5) he
afterwards ampl’ifled it into Ep. 297.'1'his suggestion agrees with the statement
ΐιᾷοέἑέ, :3:1221222‘151223023‘233 Jssssffpffi‘issassfflffiffihffi ἓξ dammi*
three times before an opportunity arrived of presenting the book to him.

The date* is given by Wolsey' s preserment. The aee of Lincoln fen vacant by

· the death os william Smith on 9 Jan.1514. Wolsey was appointed by Papal
Bull of 6 Feb. 151⁴, and consecrated at Lambeth on 96 March. The date given
by Erasmus hardly accords with that of Smith s death; but Mt. Nichols quotes
‘Helle’ s chronicle, 1550, f. 46, to the effect that Wolsey was named Bp. of Lincoln
‘on N ewers dayef apparently before his predecessor was actually dead]
