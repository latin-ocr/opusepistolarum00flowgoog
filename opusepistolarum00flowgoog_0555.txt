quam ex animo doleam tantos rerum humanarum motus exoriri,
idque nemine obsistente. Magis autem doleo nostram patriam pau-
latim his implicari malis, praesertim tam diutinis bellis non vexatam
modo sed propemodum extinctam. Vtinam hisce de rebus quae
sentio liceat tuto literis committere.

Quoties poenituit me fortunam quam ante triennium mihi Louanii
offerebas non amplexum fuisse! Sed tum quidem amplae spes me
ferocem reddiderant et aurei Britanniae montes animo concepti ; sed
eam cristam mihi depressit fortuna. Nunc si vel mediocris istic
detur, cupio cum Vlysse patriae fumum subsilientem conspicere. Te
rogo vt me iam olim tuum Erasmum adiuues; potes enim, nec
minus vis: tantum vt memineris. Bene vale.
