[Erasmus had apparently been sent on to Oxford, whither Mountjoy intended
to follow him. 'l'he length of this, his only, visit to oxford has been greatly
overestimated. Epp. roo—7 mark the beginning of his acquaintance with Colet,
the introductor-5 letter ιο which Colet refers having probably been brought by
Erasmus. Epp. 108-11 are in direct sequence with 0110 another and may there-
fore be presumed to have occupied no very great period of time. The reference
to Ep. 106 at the beginning of Ep. 108 seems to imply no long interval between
them ; and the expression, Ep. 108. 17, Band 1 12, 3, of a wish for a daily interchange
ol views, ⁴ ita vt coepimus,' supports this opinion. In Ep. 108 too the words in
which Erasmus accounts for his coming ιο Oxford seem to me to apply better to
a first visit than to a return, as Mr. Seebohm supposes. As Ep. 108 is written in
the winter (1. 78), 1ι follows that Ep. 106 cannot have been written much earlier
than October, and Erasmus' arrival in Oxford may therefore be placed at the same
time, unless Colet was absent from Oxford when he first came; for which,
though possible, there is not a shadow of evidence.

Thi· letter precedes Ep. 106 because the words ⁶ hic omnia durissima videntur '
seem ιο express dissatisfaction with new surroundings and are in strong
contrast with the eulogies o! Ep. 115.]
