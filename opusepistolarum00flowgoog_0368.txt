334 LETTERS oF ERASMUS [¹50¹

mitti litterulam, imo vero nisi forem animo quam lenissimo, iustam
videbar habere causam succensendi atque obiurgandi tui. Scripsi

10 ad te iterum atque iterum, si tamen litterae perferuntur; vnas certe
perlatas nihil ambigo.

De libellis Adagiorum Erasini quid sum responsurus homini mei
studiosissime, quum me horum libellorum admonebit ’ἓ Ita me tu
ames, mi Seruati, vt tabellionem Parisiorum iamiam affore metuo.

¹5 Nam quomodo Erasmo nostro satisfaciam haereo; cui sane vt
multum debeo, ita nihil gratiae vel meapte negligentia vel fortuna
refero. Itaque si quid meministi tui Guilielmi, fac me de his rebus
quamprimum certiorem. Dicam an sileam ⁴? Vereor (cur enim
dissimulem ?) alterum e duobus in me euenire, aut, sicut tritum est

ιο verbum, qui extra conspectum sit, eum animo excidisse, aut successisse
nouos amicos atque his nouis me veterem concessisse.

Haec nos tuo more expostulauimuS, nonnihil etiam nostro. De
illo quod scribis, quid spei restat? Obdura animum et temet rebus
seruato secundis. Mobilis est fortuna atque vt temere nocet, ita

25 interdum temere prodest. Fortassis spe citius numina te respicient.
Vale, sodalium dulcissime3 tui amores bene valeant. Denique nihil

praetermittas quod scire mea intersit aut iucundum mihi fore
arbitrabere. Ex bibliotheca mea ipso die Epiphaniae multa nocte.

[Plainly 1501 because the negotiation about Dismas is still on hand. Though
dated some days before Epp.144-6, it was evidently sent at the same time.

Antony of Bergen (14 July 1455-12 Jan.1533) was the fourth son of John,
fifth Lord of Glimes and Ber-gen (p. ι44). He was Abbot first of Hont

the family ofAremberg, who imprisoned him an only released him on ransom.
For a time he retired to Louvain, where he was supported by his elder brother
John. When John de Lannoy, Abbot of St. Bet-tinp at po.St Omer, died on 27 Nov.
1492, the monks elected J ames ydu Val to succeed him. But through the influence
of Henry of Bergen, Bp. of cambray, with the young Archduke Philip, the
Pope was persuaded to annul the election and appoint Antony3 who, in spite
of Du Val’ s consecration on 2 July ¹493 by the Β. of Terouenne’ s suffragan
(see p. 303), was forcibly installed by his brother, t 0 Biehop‚ later· ιιι the same
month, and retained undiaturbedy possession till his death (GC. iii. 505.

marriage to Philibert of Savoy, which was celebrated on 26 Sept. On 7 Noc.
1503 he met Philip, who was returning from Spain, at 81. Trond, and entertained
