Epistole . . . Gaguini (1498), no. 70. (Paris.)
(September 1495 *9)

[This and the following letter are printed in two editions of Gaguin's
Epistola st Oreticum, Paris, Durand Gerlier, August 1498? (a) and D. Gerlier
and And. Bocard, 22 Nov. 1498 (B), but were never included by Erasmus in
his conespondence. They are plainly at the beginning of his connexion with
Gaguin, Ep. 43 answering Erasmus' first introduction of himself, and Ep. 44

to the year 1494; the argument being that if Erasmus· intimacy with Gaguiu
was merely incipient on 24 Sept. 1495 (Ep. 44), it could not have developed
sufficiently for him to have composed Ep. 45, and have procured its insertion
in the first edition of Gaguin's History, published 30 Sept. 1495. But an examina-
tion of the structure of that volume shows this reasoning to be fallacious. It
consists of 1361eaveS‚ seventeen signatures of eight, of which the first 134 are
numbered. 'l'he History ends with Finis at the bottom of P. 134. At the
opening of f⁰. 135 is a short poem by Gaguin of seven couplets, followed by
the colophon, ‘Anno salutis Mille-simo quadrimmtesimo nonaqesimonono (cf. p. 148)
pridie kalendarum octobr-um! The remainder of the page is occupied with four
couplets by Faustus Andrelinus in praise of the History, and on the verso
is smectica· Montenati paludium with the same theme ς the book being described
by Faustus as editae, by Montenatus as statim camelae, and much space being
wasted. ΕΟ. 136 is entirely filled with Erasmus' letter (Ep. 45), each page
having forty-nine lines instead of the usual forty·flve.

The inference from this is that the History having been completed by 30 Sept.
the printer was left with three and a half blank pages, which he was at some
difficulty to fill. By judicious spacing a page and a half were covered with
Faustus’ and Montenatus' compositions; and then, as we may infer, Erasmus
offered for the last leaf this letter, which his facile pen had drawn out to a
greater length than was necessary. The fact that the extra lines were crowded
on to f‘. 136, instead of being accommodated in some of the vacant space on
Ρ. 135, suggests that that leaf was already printed off before Erasmus' letter
was begun. Thus Ep. 45 instead of being placed before 30 Sept. 1495 must
be placed at least some days later, and in this case days are of importance.

Other considerations help ιο confirm the view that these letters, and therefore
Erasmus· arrival in Paris, are to be placed in 1495. The publication of Erasmus’
poem to Faustus (Ep. 47 introd.) is said to have occurred when their friendship
was newly-formed gi. p. 3. 22-5) 3 an event which occurred shortly after Erasmus'
arrival (Ep. 44. 3ο). In App. a it is shown that there is reason for making his
departure from Steyn as late as possible; the entire absence of any other
correspondence from Paris in 1494 and the first half of 1495 is also suggestive;
in Ep. 47. 7 seq. Erasmus writes as a newcomer, and the reference to Faustus'
poem (Ep. 44. 30) strongly supports the date here assigned. The mention of
Gaguin's illness (Ep. 44. 1) is inconclusive, since he describes himself (GE. 77
and cf. 78) as having been ill throughout the year of printing.

Ι conclude therefore that Erasmus came to Paris from the Bishop of Cambray's
household in the late summer of 1495. There he introduced himself to Gaguin,
the leading figure in the Paris world of letters, and an opportunity offering
to make himself known by attaching his name ιο Gaguin's book then on
the eve of publication, he speedily availed himself of it by the composition
of Ε 45.

Saffo copies of the first edition of the History have two more leaves,
unnumbered‚ containing eight columns of Bru-ata. They were evidently added
later by the desire of Gaguin, who was greatly vexed at the faulty printing‚
