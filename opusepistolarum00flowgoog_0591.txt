ERASMVS GONELLO SVO Β. D.

Mvvrxs modis haec tempora nos affligunt, mi Gonelle. Pestis hic
passim scintillat, mox vti videtur saeuitura. Bellum imminet,
malorum omnium oceanuS. Nos priuata etiam quaedam incommoda
discruciant, praeterquam quod nuper exortus- est mihi nouus 'genius
malus, bestiola quaedam perpusilla quidem, sed quae tantum habeat 5
veneni vt prae hoc vipera, quin et seps, veneno vacare videatur.
Rogo vti per Vuatsonum ad nos scribas3 et quid agat meus Pegasus
significes, imo quid valeas ipse, quid hospes tuus humanissimus,
quid materfamilias, omnis bonitatis exemplar. Fac diligenter salutes
Greanum commissarium, communem* amicum- vel, vt verius dicam, ιο
patronum. Bene vale. Londini. [Anno 11. n.xv.]
