ΤΟ CORNELIUS GERARD

Quamobrem,

mi Corneli, nihil visum est nobis quare in literarum studio aetatem
otiose velimus consumere, adeo vt iam diu a literis animum prorsus
abduxerimus. Accessit praeterea his rebus corporis non satis recta 10
valetudo, quae et ipsa ingenii ardorem non minuere modo verum

etiam extinguere solet.

Veruntamen, quoniam nulla nobis res aeque proposita est in vita
quam tibi omnibus in rebus gratificari, obsequi, morem gerere (vt
certe pro cumulatissimis tuis in me beneficiis debeo maxime), hanc 15
rursus operam tui causa suscepimus, orationemque tuam quam
petieras quo potuimus studio absoluimus. Partes praeterea oratorias,
itidem quam quaeque speciem, quem quaeque colorem habeat, studiooe
annotare curauimus; vt tu quidem potiare voto tuo, gratulenturque

studio nostro litterati, videant autem et inuideant illiterati, erubescant

scioli et iactabundi3 porro mediocres aliquid sibi profectus ferant.
Haec enim, mi Corneli, hominum genera nusquam non reperies.
Litterati qui sunt litteras magnopere non probare, non amare non
possunt. At hi qui omnium artium sunt imperiti, damnandae, lace·
