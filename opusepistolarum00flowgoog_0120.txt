rnelius Gerardus or Gerardi of (huda, also called Aurelius and Aurotinus,
was a kinsman of Wm. Herman (Epp. 23. 68 and 28. 6 ς 111 ι110 Gouda HS. 1323
each addresses the other as nepos), and was presumably older than Erasmus, who
is said to have been his pupil (Alard of Amsterdam's pref. to Cornelius' Rotaria).
He was perhaps educated at Deventer; since it was his interest in the school
which led him to compose his Mariua. in order ιο provide the boys with suitable
reading (Deventer MS. 31, f. 1 νο). He made his profession as an Augustinian
canon in St. Martin's 011 the Donck‚ or Hemsdonck (Burmann, Hadrianus VI,
p. 271), lying S.W. of Schoonhoven‚ and about ten miles from Gouda; a convent
founded in 1424 from that of St. Michael at Hem, near Sohoonhoven, and
belonging ιο ι110 Chapter of Sion (see App. a and van Heussen, i. 327, 8).
But his residenoe there was not continuous3 for he was transferred from one
convent, and even from one Chapter, to another, and was at various times
an inmate also of Hieronymiana vallis, an Augustinian convent in the district
of Lopsen outside the W. gate of Iasiden, which belonged to the Chapter of
Windesheim‚ and of St. Michael’s at Hem (Gouda MS. 1323, f. 6ov0). Whilst at
Hemsdonck he composed an Alphabdum Redemptor—um (Leiden MS. Vule. 98 G).
dedicated ιο Jacobus Cornelii, Prior superior and vicar-general of the Chapter
of Sion, as ‘studii nostri primicias '. His correspondence with Herman from
Lopsen in the Gouda MS. 1323 is perhaps ιο be dated 1489-93 (see Ap . 9).
In 1494 after having served as Steward he was made Prior of Hem onck
(v, Berkum, Beseluw. d. Stad δαιοωιλουση, p. 446, cf. Ep. 37); and there he
perhaps began the Mat-iad (Ep. 40). Τ110 first decade of this was finished at
Iaopsen (Molhuysen, p. 22), in eighteen months (Deventer MS. 31, f. 1 νο), and
the whole was completed before 1499.

From Lopsen in the autumn of 1497 110 went to Paris (see p. 205) as
a member ot the commission for the reform of the Abbey of St. Victor invited
from the Chapter of windesheim (GC. vii. 836). He remained at St. Victor's
till 16 Aug. 1498, and while there took the opportunity to address a letter to
Gaguin for inclusion in the third edition of that author’s Histories ζ 31 Har. ¹49}ss
see pp. 148, 9), and composed verses in honour of the Abbey library (GR. ii. 75
and Molhuysen. p. 34). It was probably at this time that he entered Paris
University (Holhuysen, p. 37) 3 but Ι 001111οι find his name in the lists of degrees.
Aster finishing the Παήαά 110 began a metrical version of the Psalms (Leiden MS.
Vulc. 99), the first part of which was written before 1499, since in the preface to
the second part it is implied that Boetius was still livium but the whole was not

in close connexion with Erasmus and with Reman, whose Ode 5 is addressed
‘ Ad Cornelium Goudensem, virum non vulgariter litteratum sibique studiorum
communium societate copulatissimum’; but afterward8‚ although there was
no break of friendship, the tie was less close. 'I'he poet’s laurei was conferi-ed
upon him by Maximilian when staying at Liesveld, near Schoonhoven (Βαωυία.
p. 793 cf. Gouda MS. 1323, f. 6ov⁰); perhaps in Oct. 1508, at which time the
Emperor was in that neighbourhood. His residenoe at Hem was subsequent
to this (Gouda MS. ibid.). He speaks (Leiden MS. Vulc. 66, f. 4) of being
intimate with the future Pope Adrian VI, when Adrian was Provost of
st. Saviour’s at Utrecht (1514-21). In 1516 110 was at Lopsen engaged on
a life of St. Jerome, which he had undertaken at the request of the Prior and
Canens of Hieronymiana vallis at Dolst, from notes collected during his
residence in Paris (Deventer MS. 323 cf. LB. App. 66 and 89) ς but when he
speaks in a letter (Batavis, p. 95 ς 1517—83 ?) of being allowed to return from exile
to his ‘propria sedes,’ he perhaps means Hemsdonek‚ where he is found in
1519 and ¹523-4 (Leiden MSS. Vule. 99 Β, f. 88 and 66, f. 131 ; tho latter being
a poem on the death of John of Wassenaar, 6 Dec. 1523). In his last years
he seems to have returned to Lopsen 3 but nothing is known of his death.
