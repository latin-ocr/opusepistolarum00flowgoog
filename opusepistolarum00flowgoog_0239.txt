[This letter belongs to the period when Erasmus was teaching Lord MonntJoy.
It might equally well be placed after the return from 'Pom-nehem (Epp. 87—91).

Wm. Blount, fourth Baron Hountjoy (ο. 1479-8 Nov. 1534), suocoeded his
father as a child in 1485, and remained under the guardisnship of his mother
until ¹499· It has been commonly supposed on the ground of the worthlees
year-date added in H and ol Beatus Rhenanus’ conjecture in iv.69, that he paid
two visits to Paris to study ς and Ep. 117 lends nome oolour to this view. But
Epp. 88 and 89 show that Erasmus hul not known Mountjoy for long before
going to Tournehem. His visit may be dated by the grace ‘ven by the Pmeident
and renem of queem· 0011 , cambriam, to πωπω-«1 {nn 89 to „company
Hountjoy abroad, dated 03 rch 1498. The date in t e Col ege register is
1⁴97 ς but Mt. Ρ. G. Phintowe, Librarian of Queens' college, has kindly informed
me that from the arrangement of the register there can be no doubt that 149} is
intended. Ι do not agree with Mt. Nichols thst i. p. 18. 7-16 necessarily implies
that Hountjoy was nnmarried when Erasmus wrote the Encemium Matrimonii for
himin Paris. From consideration ot Lady Mountjoy's age in 1497 (Ep. 105. 3 11.)
and the words ‘nouis nuptiis’ (Ep. 117. 7), it seems likely that though the
