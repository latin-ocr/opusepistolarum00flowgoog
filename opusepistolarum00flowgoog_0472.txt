¹7· Nouum Testamentum] As early
as 1499 Aldus had projected an edition
of the Bible, 000 Grocin's letter in
Aldus· Aser-onoma· Veteres, Oct. 1499,
Prv⁰3 butit was notcarried outtill
Feb. 1518. Cf. iv. 08011.

00. Latimerus](146o?—c. Sept. 1545),
an English scholar of great fame in his
own day, who has left, however, no
memorial in his work. He became
Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, in
1489, and graduated B.A.; after which
he went to Italy and studied there for
six or seven years. Pace found him
at Padus in 1498 or 9, and there is
a letter from him to Aldus dated from
Padm, 4 Nov. 1498 (P) (ΑΕ. 87). As
Erasmus never alludes to meeting him
in Italy, the translations from Euripides
were probably shown to him and to
'Punstall in London (cf. Ep. 185. 13 n.);
so that his return maybe placed before
1506. He perhaps remained in London
for some years, for he was not incorpo-
rated as MA. at Oxford till 18 Nov.
1513. About that time he was chosen
as tutor 10 Reginald Pele, who gradu-
ated B.A. at Oxford in 1515, and to
whom Latimer’s subsequent 0001001-
astical preferment may be traced. In
1516, when he visited London from
exford, Erasmus and More endeavoured
to persuade him to stay and teach
Greek to Fisher‚ Bp. of Roohester3 but
he declined 011 1110 ground that for
eight or nine years he had been en·
gaged 10 011101· studies and had not
touched Latin or Greek. For the same
reason 110 declared himself unable 10
help Erasmus 111 preparing for 0 0000οᾱ
edition of his N. Τ. Τ11000 studies
were perhaps musical3 for Pace (De
mm, p. 34) speaks of being urged by
Latimer to interest himself in that
subject, and of having taken it up at
Rome when there in Cardinal Bain-
bridge's train‚ 1513-4.

when 110 acted 00 arbiter to fix 1110

01 1110 sale of Grocin's librar-y (0118.
Cenaeum, 11. 1890, pp. 308, 9). His
latter years were perhaps spent as a
pai-ish priest, for besides a prebend 01
Salisbury he held the livings of Woeton·
sub-Edge and Saintbury in 0100000101·-
shire 3 in the latter church his pertrait
remains in a stained-glass window.

Donstallus] cuthbert 'hinstall
(1474—18 Nov. 1559), bastard 0011 of
aYorkshire nobleman. After studying
01 Oxford and Cambridge he went to
Italy, before ¹49⁸-9 (ΕΗΒ. xviii. 516),
and graduated LLD. at Padua, where
between 1501-3 (Ep. 005 introd.) he
enjoyed ‘longe familiarite' with Je-
rome Busleiden (Brewer, ii.x 1383).
10 110131, 100, 110 met James Faber
stapulensis (Lond. iii. 0, LB. 070). Ηο
11οᾱ returned 10 England by Dec. 1506,
when he received his first benefice 3
and soon won the favour of Abp. War-
ham, whose Chanoellor he had become
by 00 J uly 1509 (Reg. warham, f. 13),
0οᾶ for whom, 00 Commissa-y, he
conducted the archiepiscopal visitation
of 1511. He was sent as ambassador
to Prinoe Gharles' court at Bruges in
1515, 10 0010300 1519, Worms 1500-1,
and 'l'oledo 1505; and in 1508-9 110
helped to negotiate the Treaty of 0010-
bray. He was made Dean of salisbury
1501, Bp. of London 1500, Bp. of Dur—
ham 15303 and in 1537 was President
of the Council of the North. In the
Reformation his sympathies were with
Rome, though strongly opposed to per-
secution 3 and he was twice deprived of
his see, at the end of Edward vr's reign
and under Elizabeth. See DNB.
