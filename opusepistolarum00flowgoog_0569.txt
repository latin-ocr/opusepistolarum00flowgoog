(October 1 5¹ 3.)

[The Record office in London contains among the State Papers of Henry vnt
(ς 9, ff. 99, 100) two leaves, forming a connected sheet, on the rectos of which
are written four letters; on the verso of f. 99 is inscribed in a xvi⁶ hand
‘Erasmus’ tres,' the verso of f. 100 is blank. The letters on f. 99 have no
heading or direction, except that at the beginning of the first and the end of the
second BR is written in capitale. 01 those on f. 100 the first has the heading
‘Erasmus G.S et 0.s·; the second has at the root ‘Honorato viro G. ludi
magistro, amico singularL' All four are written by the same hand; which
from the abundance of errors was plainly that of an inexperienced copyist.

The two letters on f. 100 are probably addressed to the same person, from the
similarity of Erasmus' expressed intention of coming with Watson. The
directions about the horse in the former (Ep. 976) are in the same tone as
Erasmus· remarks to Gonell on the same subject (Epp. 974, 987, 989), and
Ep. 999 gives a suggestion that Gonell was a schoolmaster. G.S. in the heading
to Ep. 976 is very possibly an error of the copyist, attaching s for Saluum to the
names of both persons addressed; and if this is so, there is no difficulty in
identifying G with William Gonell. The close similarity of Ep. 976 to Epp.
977, 9 establishes these two letters as genuine.

The letters on f. 99 are however different. They are plainly addressed to
semeone in charge of pupils, as each speaks of sending books suitable for educa·
tion3 and the latter expressly refers to the appropriateness of the gift. They
may therefore be regarded as written to Gonell. But the style is hardly that of
Erasmus; and the tone is much more fonnal and elaborate than that of his
other letters to this intimate friend. It seems to me, therefore, most probable
that the two leaves in question come from a letter-book in which Gonell had his
letters copied, perhaps by some pupil in his school ; and that the first two letters
surviving were written to Gonell by someone, whose initials were RR, only the
last two being by Erasmus. Accordingly 1 have not included the first two
letters in the text, but they are printed in App. ως Mr. Nichols‚ who prints these
letters for the first time (vol. ii. Ap . 1), regards all four as letters of Erasmus.

Res hic eodem loco sunt, vt adhuc incertus animi sim an istuc
mihi sit recurrendum. Rursum periit quidam non longe a collegio,
et medicus Bont periit ruri et domi filiola. Quare gratum mihi
facies, si non transferes lectos intra quatriduum. Si venio, veniam

cum Watsono nostro. Bene vale. 5
Honorato viro G. ludi magistro amico singulari.

[Subsequent to Ep. 975, since Erasmus has now determined to return with
Watson. Evidently contemporary with Ep. 977, from similarity ot language.
