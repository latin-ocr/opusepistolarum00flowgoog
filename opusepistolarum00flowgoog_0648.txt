610 APPENDIX IX

the case of 1323 before the leaves were numbered; and as these gaps
occur at the stitching in the centre of the gatherings‚ the leaves seem
to have been lost after the volumes were bound. 'I'he manuscripts
are mainly the work of one person, Hand A, who, as will be seen,
wrote somewhere about 15243 with additions by a later hand, B,
writing about 1538. Both manuscripts are bound in limp vellum,
the binding of 1324 being the earlier3 since it is in the wallet form
and has ily-leaves from 8 mediaeval philosophical manuscript, whilst
1323 1188 headbands, tie-strings, stained edges (all characteristics of
a later style) and no ily-leaves ³. Both were probably written on
detached leaves, which were afterwards bound together3 but 1323
has evidently been bound twice, since its margins and the writing on
them have been much more cut down than those of 1324, and the
height of its page has been reduced from 8 inches to 73. In
1324, too, there are only two gaps where pages have fallen out; in
1323 there are at least four, two of which ⁸ have been supplied by
Hand B, who copied the loose leaves on 8 different paper and
inserted the new in place of the old.

The contents of the manuscripts are of the highest importance.
1323 opens with 8 number of letters and poems, written to or by
Cornelius Gerard of Gouda about the years 1489-93 ⁴, which have
been published for the first time by Dr. P. Ο. Molhuysen of Leiden
in NAKG. 1905, iv. 54-733 and some poems by Erasmus and
William Herman of Gouda‚ which 816 81111 unpublished (ff. 1—24).
Herman's are of interest as bringing to light 8 fact hitherto un·
known, that he was 8 pupil of Hegius 81 Ῑ)68611161; Ε188111118’ 816
evidently compositions of his early years, and are entitled Erasmus
mayistro Enyhelbeaew Leydensi, Eleyia de colmanne doloris et leticiae,
Eleqia dc praepotenti virtute Cupidinis pharetrati, Eleqia quer-ula
doloris, and 1116 Carmen Bucolicum. This last was first published by
Alard of Amsterdam after Erasmus’ death (Leiden, P. Balenus,
1538), and has been printed by Leclerc (LB. 8111. 561) from 8
manuscript formerly belonging to Peter Scriverius; in both sources
it is stated to have been composed 81 1)68611161. Τ116 version in the
Gouda manuscript was probably taken from the origina13 since the
romantic names Rosphamus and Gunifolda are used 111 place of
Pamphilus and Galatea, which it may be conjectured were substi-
tuted by Alard, together with a number of corrections in the text,
out of regard for Erasmus’ credit as 8 classic.

On ff. 24 v0-32 are copied the letters between Erasmus and
Wimpfeling, which were printed first in Erasmus’ De σφέα, Sti-as-
burg, Schurer, Dec. 1514. Thon, ff. 32—8, follow some more poems
by Cornelius Gerard, some verses of authorship unassigned, one of
which is on the election of Adrian v1 10 1116 Papacy (J an. 1522),
