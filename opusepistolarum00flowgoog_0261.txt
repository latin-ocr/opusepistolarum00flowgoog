This letter is the first pieee in Erasmus’ Lucubratiunctelae‚ nantum-piae, Th.
uertens, 15 Feb. 1503 (αἱ), and is entitled Epfflola monetaria ad capessendam
emacem ad ocneroeu‘ssimum puerum Adelphum, principem Verimsem. In later editions
of the same collection Erasmus styles it Exhortatio (ια virtutem and Oratio de eirenae
mplectenda3 butas it is cast in the form of a letter and dated, and contains
illustrative matter about Adelphus of Veere, some extracta from it may be inserted

of 1503 it is not possible ιο determine whether the first edition is to be dated
1503 or 150} The volume De precellentis potestate imperatoriae (Ep. 173) is certainly
1501 ς but the date assigned to the Paneqyric (Ep. 179) is 1504 ς so that in either case
Martens seems to have been using the old and the new systems simultaneously.
Erasmus' own untrustworthy memory decides for 1503 (Lond. xix. 91 : LB. 746).

Τ110 Lucubratiuncuzao were reprinted by Mat-tens 6 Nov. 1509 (α ²). A second
edition, supervised by Nicholas Gerbeu, was published by Schurer at Strasburg
in September 1515 (β) and reprinted without change in June 1516 and November
1517ς 0 third 117 Froben at Basle in July 1518 (7), which was reprinted by
Schssrer 111 January and by Froben in October 1519. There are also editions by
Hartens in 1520 and by Froben in August 1535, which Ι have not been able to
examine. A few changes occur in the various pieces in the Opem (vol. v) of
Is'fl’iipletter can hardly have been composed before Erasmus’ visit to Tournehem
in the spring of 1⁴993 and therefore importance may be attached to the date
assigned on its publication, in any case 1101 more than five years later. 1t was
probably written immediately after Erasmus' return from 'l'ournehem and may
have called forth the present mentioned in Ep. 94. a. On the other hand the
frequent quotations from Homer (if not inserted at the time of publication)
suggest 1500-1· cf.1·lpp.131‚132 143.

Adelphus of ’But-gund„ iord of Veere and Beveren (¹⁴90 ?—7 Dec. 1540), was
at this time quite a boy. His father, Philip of B urgundy (0·1⁴53··4 J 1117 1498),
had held important cilices, being Admiral os Flanders and (107011101- of Artois
Kt. of the Golden Fleece 1478, (10νο11101- of Flanders 1484, and 00111ιοί1101- and
chamberlain 10 the Archduke Philip; and ιο this was doubtless due the favour
shown to Adelphus by Philip (l. 35). 111 1513 Adelphus was already associated
with his kinsman, Philip of Burgundy, in the duties os the Admiral of Flanders
(Brewer, i. 3678), and when Philip became Bp. of Utrecht 111 May 1517, Adelphus
succeeded him (ibid. ii. 3236). In 1516 110 received the Order of the Golden
Fleece5 and as Admiral he rapidly became one of the leading members of
Charlee V’s Counci13 see Brewer‚ passim. In the spring and summer of 1525 he
was sent as ambassador to England3 but in his later years he becomes less
prominent. Reyner Snoy‚ who was his phy-eiciam in the preface to his Psaltert‘um,
dated ⁹9 May 1533, speaks of having reeently spent some months with
him at Duveland in Zeeland, one of his lordships (cf. RE. 11), where he was
conducting the repair of dykes broken hythe sea. About 151110 married Anne,
daughter of John, 6111 lord of Bergen (Ep. 42), and his eldest3son,uaximi1ian of
Burgundy, was born just when Erasmus visited him at Bergen in July 1514
