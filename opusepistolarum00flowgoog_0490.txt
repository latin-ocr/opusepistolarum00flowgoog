[See Ep. 210. The date of this letter may be fixed conjecturally from a letter
of Aldus Manutius, written from Bombasius' house at Bologna on 20 April 1511
(Renouard‚ p. 519). Aldus was at the time a fugitive from Venice, and had
recently passed through Fet-rara. For Bombasius' visit to Siena see Ep. 251.]
