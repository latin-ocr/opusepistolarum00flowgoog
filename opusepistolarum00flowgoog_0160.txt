[Probably written after Erasmus· departure to join the Bishop of cambray,
cf. App. 5. Erasmus had perhaps been visiting the Bp. os Utrecht (ot p. 118)
ιο obtain permission ιο leave Steyn. He seems to have communicated his
desire to the Prior, Joannes Christiani (cf. p. 74), but only informed Herman
of it after the success of the negotiatione, sending a messenger to announce that
he was passing near Steyn, and asklng Herman ιο get leave ιο accompany him
on the first stage. If this conjecture is correct, Erasmus must have been going
to Bergen, for the route from Utrecht ιο Brussels or Mechlin would hardly
pass near Gonda- For Herman's regrets at Erasmus' departure see his Ode α,
in which ⁴ Dicit vale doctissimo amico Herasfno, ad antistitem cameracensem
eugghlffilffgffi 2¹? ἕεξιθᾱῗῗῗὲῗῗὲῗ {lu} 1510) was a kinsman of cornelius
Gerard. At the age of eight he was the pride of his first schoolmaster, probably
Winckel at Gouda; and afterwards he was a pupil of Hegius at Deventer
(Gouda ΜΒ. 1323. ff. 21⁸ v⁰, 10-17, and 21). He must therefore have been a friend
and companion of Erasmus from his earliest γοα-ες since it appears from the
certamen Erasmi oe Guielmi (LB. viii. 565), composed ‘ anno eorum decimo nono,’
that they were of the same age. He entered the monastery of Steyn, but about
1489-90 (ἲ) was sent with one of his fellow monks ιο a cell at Haarlem (cf. Ep. 28.
4n. and Gouda MS. 1323. ff. 18 and ε). Before Erasmus left the monastery, how·
ever, Herman had returned ιο it. He is introduced as a prominent figure into the
Antibarbari (p. 101), from which it appears that he visited Erasmus at Halstcren in
1493 App. 5). From his life of freedom in a University Erasmus writes con·
tin to Herman, encouragin him to share his studies and to write to his
learn friends and patrons; an when he returned to Paris in 1496, after a visit
to Helland‚ he brought with him for publication some of Herman’s poema, the
sulm Odaram (Ep. 49), which throw much light on the early life of the two
friends. In the summer of 1500 Herman came on Batt’s invitationtoTournehem
(Ep. 129); and in 1501 Erasmus visited him at Haarlem (Ep. 157), ι110 relations
between the two being for a time however less cordial than formerly.

Some years before his death he began ιο compose a history of Holland‚ for
which Erasmus gives him high praise in the Panmric (LB. iv. 512 n). A more
substantial account of it is given by John of Naaldwyk‚ who wrote a similar
work, now in MS. in the British Museum, about 1514 (Vitell. F. xv). This John
delayed his own book in expectation of the Latin history, on which Herman
was known to be spending great peina, travelling over the country to collect
materiale ; and only took it in hand when Herman’s death made it useless to
wait lo er (see Muller in Εὕα. v. vaderlandsche Geschied. 1888, pp. 400-1).
Part of {erman’s history, recounting charles of Gueldres' invasion of Helland
and its repulse by Philip in the winter of 1504-5, was published st Amsterdam
in black letter with the title Οὶαηάἰο canoque bollum, but without date, as the
work of ‘ wilhelmus Hermannus Olandus Goudanus, Canonicus diui Aurelii
A tini.’ It appears from the preface that the book was not published at once,
an it is perha s implied that Herman had returned to Steyn by 1505. A copy
of this rare vo ume is in the British Museum. It is reprinted in the Anam
veteru historiae, vol. i, of Matthaeus, who in spite of the mention of Philip ascribes
the events narrated to the ear 1507. Herman also made a prose version of
some of Avianus’ fables, wit a preface tc Florenee, Baron of Isselsteyn, which
were perhaps printed in 1502 or 1503 (Epp. 17² and 178), though no copy is
known. They were certainly in circulation in November 1511 (see Barland’s
preface to Aesopi Fabulae, Antwerp, Th. Martens, οε April 1512), but were
first printed with some prose versions of Aesop by Herman, dedicated to the
same Florence‚ in an en ed edition of the same book, Louvain, Th. Martens,
21 Sept. 1513. The date o his death is given from the Necrologium of Steyn
in 1. W(alvis') Boschm. d. Stad conda, i. 2443 and is roughly confirmed by an
epita h on him in Barland’s edition of the syzaa Oderunt, 24 Sept. 1512 (p. 160).
Ala of Amsterdam speaks or him as his teacher (LB. App. ⁶⁶3 cf. App. ο).

The Guillermus de flenda, dioc. Traiectensis, who was ΒΑ. at Paris 1496,
BLA. 1497, is robably the Franciscan author of the Ordo Missae, which was
printed sev times at the end of xv⁰; since there is nothing to show that

Herman was ever in Paris. GE. 77, dated 16 Sept. 1496), implies that he was
then in Holland. For Herman see Ruelens, p. xxiii.
