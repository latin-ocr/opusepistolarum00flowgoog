206 LETTERS oF ERASMUS [1498

1497, as he has applied to it a MS. which refers to an earlier mission headed
bylgiaelbnugssgshlggga part of this mission of 1497—8, it is difficult to apply to it
the passage quoted above. Alard’s preface to the Batavis is dated 1515 and
cannot be earlier than 1514, since it mentions that Etasmus was at Basle. It
invites Cornelius as an authority on the subject ιο combat a statement, which

was being freely made at Louvain and was chammoned by Gerard Geldenhauer
of Nymegen‚ ιο the effect that Holland did not coi-respond to the ancient
Batavia. Alard’s letter was evidently called forth by a volume published by
Martens at Louvain in 1514, M. Domi . . . Optaecula, containing an epistle by
chrysostom of Naples De situ Houandiae, advancing that opinion, and a letter of
Goldenhauer's do Zdandia, in which Holland was disparaged by comparison.
'l'o this Cornelius replied with a Defensio aeonae Batauam, dedicated to Reyner
Snoy of Gouda, which forms Bk. i of Batat‘ia. Bk. ii„ in which Cornelius·
statement occurs, was entitled by its author E'lucidarium variarum quaestionum super
Batondna maiam et differentia, and was also dedicated to Snoy. It amplifies the
Defensio and refers ιο it in several places; and is therefore later in date. Accord-
“ ly the visit to Paris referred to should not be placed earlier than 1502-3.

o bring the visit of 1497-8 and the statement in the Batavis into agreement
it is necessary to suppose either that Cornelius (who is, however, usually precise
in his dates) wrote duo for tria, perhaps iu· for u'i 3 or that the Batavis was written
in 1509-10 and only produced five years later in response to Alard's request.
Either view seems to me more probable than to suppose a second visit; since
the known circumstances of his visit accord completely with the mission from

vgili'idesheim, and there is no traoe οἰ a second mission invited by the Parliament
ο aris m 1502.

This letter must have been written not long after Cornelius’ departure.]

ERASMVS CORNELIO OANONIGO DOCTO S. D.

Annon: superbum te Gallia remisit, vt plebeios amiculos fastidire
coeperis ⁴? Satrapis scribis, Erasmo non scribis. Quo meo merito ⁴?
Sed habes causam probabilem et haud scio an veram. Nihil minus
opinabar, inquis, quam te in Francia resedisse, qui tum certo consilio

5 in Italiam iter parabas. Age, nihil refell0‚ accipio causam, modo
hoc damni quam verbosissima epistola sax-tias Noui quod scriberem
nihil erat. Me tui esse amantissimum vetus est. Boschio quid
acciderit miror, iampridem enim ab eo nihil redditur. De nostro
recessu hic mussatur. Tu fac de toto tuo itinere rerumque tuarum

ιο statu vt sciam. Si quid hic meo studio, cura, diligentia praestari
posse iudicabis, id pro tuo iure audacter a me flagitabis. Meam
dignitatem‘ne tibi commendem, arctissima nostra et vetus necessitudo
postulare videtur. Guilhelmum meum, imo tuum, tuis monitis
excitare ne desinas, vt aliquid se dignum moliatur. Meis de rebus

¹5 certi nihil significare potui, quum omnia penderent. Valemus adhuc
et te vehementer amamus. Petrum nostrum, quod faciS, fac quam

arctissime complectare. Si in his quae tibi pro nostra necessitudine
impartii, vt Harpocrati satisfacias admoneam, videbor parum recte
de tua fide deque tuo in me animo sentire. Quanquam sint qui te

19. sunt H.
