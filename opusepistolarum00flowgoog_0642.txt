604 APPENDIX VIII

of his Ὲῇαὶςίοῑαε, while 311 ⁶ came as treasure to Leclero ; the former
consisting mainly of elegant epistles from Erasmus, the latter of his
more familiar correspondence and of letters and verses from his
friends. An examination of the letters printed by Erasmus enables
the period during which the letter-book was written 10 118 determined
with accuracy. of the 53 letters contained in the three earliest
volumes of Erasmus’ Epistles‚ A, B, 888 0¹, published in August 1515,
Oct. 1516, and April 1517, only three, all from B, appear 18 the
Deventer book, and one of these is a fragment of a few lines only
(f. 123), against which the scribe, Hand A, probably the earliest, 1188
written ‘impressa est,’ having discovered his error before he had
gone far. But of the 63 letters in D, published in August 1518, as
· many as 35 are written in the Deventer book, besides 15 which are
published in E, Oct. 1519, and 1 in F, August 1521. That these
were written into the book before the publication of D is shown by
the fact that a number of them contain corrections⁶ and additions in
Erasmus’ hand, which are embodied in the printed text. It is a plain
inference, therefore, that the letter-book was copied by Erasmus’
pupils during the years 1517-8.

The distribution of the letters contained in the manuscript throws
further light on its composition. Out of 366 in all, 336 can bo
sssfligned with certainty to their years, which are distributed as
o ows:

⁷ 1509-12. 4

1514. 11
Ι515· 29
1516. 49
1517. 150
1518. 90

888 3 18181, which formed no part of the original letter-book. Of
these letters 168 are by Erasmus, 168 by his friends. 'Phe &¹³⁰3
17 July 1517 forms a sort of dividing line. Only one of Erasmus
letters (LB. App. 81, dated 28 Sept. 1516) falls before it ; only 26 Of
his friends’ letters are later. It 18 80110881118 11181 1118 4 letters

Altogether six, or perhaps five, hands can be distinguished in the

book. They may be arranged as follows:

1. Hand A, which covers ff. 93-204 continuously, except for a
letter written by Hand D 011 f. 93 v0, evidently in a blank epm,
and for f. 102, also written by Hand D, which is plainly out of
place. Τ118 writing varies to a most remarkable degree, &⁰2²
