Si reuerendus D. Rophensis in tempore cognouisset animum meum
et ego illius, fortassis iam istic adessem. Aut egregie fallor, aut is
vir est vnus cum quo nemo sit hac tempestate conferendus vel integri·
tate vitae, vel eruditione, vel animi magnitudine; vnum excipio

cantuariensem tanquam Achillem ; qui solus hic me retinet', etiamsi
non admodum volentem.

Saluta D. Paceum nostrum, et ingenii mei foetus illi commenda,
ne pereant. Scripsi iam senas literas, nullae adhuc ad me venerunt

praeter vnas Pacei, et eas quidem apertas et sero. Saluta humanissi-
mum illum oratorem Pannoniorum (nam adesse suspicor), D. Ioannem

Polonum, collegam tuum, ac reliquos amicos. Bene vale.

Erasmus was in Iaondon again, nominating proctors or the parish of Aldington,
in Kent ς to which he had been appointed as rector by Archbishop warham on
22 March, in succession to John Allen (Ep. 24⁴· 14 n.) resigned. Erasmus did
not hold the living long and there is nothing to show that he ever visited it. It
appears from Ep, 296. 124, 5 that the value of the living was about 2233 6⁸. 801.

On 31 July 1512 Warham appointed in his place John Thornton, Suffragan Bp.
of Dover. titular Bp. of Cyrene ¹, and Prior of st. Martin’s at Dover (Hasted, Hid.
os Kent, iv. 100, 1) ; allowing Erasmus to draw a yearly pension of 220 from the
living, half to be paid at Michaelmas and half at Lady Dsy, the first payment to
be made Michaelmas 1513. 111 1110 document sanctioning this arrangement the
Archbishop states expressly that it is his practice not to allow livings to be
charged with pensions, but that he makes an exception in the case of Erasmus,
‘viri in literis et Latinis et Grecis consummatissimi, qui tempora nostra sua
doctrina ac facundia velut sydus quoddam illustrat'; and gives as reasons for
breaking his rule Erasmus' ignorance of English, and ‘ singularis . . . in Anglos

illi satis opulente vitam agere, 11110 se conferre maluit . . . vt hic curn amicis
quod reliquum est vitae traduceret.'

Extracts from Warham’s Register, ff. 345-7‚ concerning these transactione are
given by Knight‚ Life of Erasmus, App. pp. xl-xliii3 and the documenta in
Erasmus· possession, which are now in the University Library st Basle, are
printed by Vischer, Bruanium, pp. 9-15. Erasmus‘ own account of the matter is

⁸ It appears from Hasted that the Suffragans of Dover bore the titles of foreign
bishoprics, which were, however, purely nominal. Thornton’s title is given
variously as Cironensis (vischer‚ pp. 14, 5), Syrenensis, Sirenensis, Sironensis,
Sirynensis Reg. Warham), Syrymensis (VVood‚ Fasti oxonienses, 1815, i. 40), and
Sirimensis Hasted). The Suffragan to the Abp. of Cologne also bore the title
of Bp. of Cyrene at this time ; see AHVN. xix. ²35 and passim.
