nummatissimus, et qui episcopatum oblatum recmt, quod
illiteratiorem se non ignoraret. Intra annum nihilominus a rege
ad episcopatum reuocandus, quanquam citra omnem etiam episco-
patum plus duo millia scutatorum annue possidet. Is vbi de meis ιο
literis audiuit, me incredibili amore coepit complecti, obscurare,
venerari3 nam aliquandiu in familia mea vixit. Centum scutatos
obtulit, si se annum docere voluissem3 obtulit beneficium intra
paucos menses3 obtulit trecentos scutatos mutuos, si ad dignitatem
comparandam opus fuisset, donec de beneficio reddidissem. Eram ¹5
mihi omnes huius vrbis Anglos eo beneficio deuinctum, omnes
enim sunt ex primatibus, et per eos totam Angliam, si voluissem.
Contempsi et rem amplissimam et spem multo ampliorem· ‚ con-
tempsi et preces et lachrimas quas precibus addebant. Rem veram

Lm qs Eme, Henry ιιι the expected struggle with
J ames ιν over Perkin Warbeck. It is

ble that having thus compromised

before 1470, became Bp. ol 1315 in
1506, and took part in the foundation
of Christ's and st. John· s Oolleges at
Cambridge· and this viewis supported
by Ur. moliole, 1.p ,ud 1 cannot find

twenty-one at this time. It appears
from a letter of John ·,Bamsay forfeited
Lord Bothwell‚ Henry vu’s secra
agent in Scotland (Ellis, Oria. Laetera,
Pirst Series, i. p. ⁸3), that in August

await the issue of eventu the date
well with his having arrived
in Paris nupto-imo on 13 Sept„ and the
circumstance perhaps accounting for
his joining a party of English noble-
men. The Ladon qs Anam Hulwan-ton
(ed. Innes, p. 88) mentions nsfflyment

Scottish reoords again until οι July ¹⁴97

1t may be noted that the next Abp.
of st. Androna, Alexander Stevart,
natural son of James w, also went
abroad to study and was Erasmus·
pupil in Italy in ι5ο8-9.

It is possible that Erasmus was
afterwards persuaded to monnider his
mrum to teach this wealthy young
noble; for his works (LB. iv. ⁶⁹33 ol.
i. p. 18. ar) include a declamat-ion styled

‘Oratio Episcopi mmo-don& iis qui sibi
