in tanto autore non ferendas. Eas omnes partim conferendis exem·

armis aut Homericus Achilles aut Aeneas Vergilianus munitior. N am 35
et fortius est cum viciis quam cum viris congredi, et vt rectissime
scripsit ille, ὅπλον μέγιστόν ἐστιν ἡ ’pn-31 βροτοῖς, quod homines nullis
armis melius armentur quam virtute. Et quanquam a iurisperitorum
latissimis campis opimam frugem demetis, tamen hic agellus licet
angustus, si diligenter excolueris, omnia vnus suppeditabit. Hinc 40
efficacis succi herbas legas licebit, quibus per media monstra ad
vellus aureum penetres. Neque alibi reperies Homericam illam
herbam quam moly nominant, repertu difficillimam, contra omnia
Circes veneficia praesentissimam antidotum. Hinc vel laureum
surculum qui consilia tua bene fortunet, vel aureum ramum decerpere 45
poteris, quo tutus etiam inferos adeas. Hic fons ille diuinus honestatis
in quatuor riuulos se diuidit, qui potus non solum vocalem, vt Aonius
ille, verum etiam immortalem faciat3 cuius vndis, si subinde mentis
artus timeris, velut Achilles alter ad omnia fortunae tela impene-

[The following group of letters hange closely together and must be placed in
1501 ; since they are subsequent ιο the visit ιο Orleans, where Erasmus’
acquaintance with Tutor was formed, and to the removal of Dismas into Tutor’s
house, but prior to the death of Batt, which took place before a July 15οα

( 'fam egurse of Erasmus' journey to Helland is not easy to trace; the following
seems to me the most probable sequence of events. He left Paris because of
the plague, shortly after Ep. 152 was written, and proceeded at once to Holland,
where he spent more than a mouth (Ep. 154. 45 ιι), visiting his friends at
Steyn and going on alterwards to Haarlem ιο see William Herman (Ep. 157).
It was perhaps on this occasion that he visited Amsterdam (Lond. xxiv. 7:
LB. 8⁶8). He returned by Dordrecht, 9 June (Ep. 157), and Ziriczee, where
he spent several days (Ep. 157), to visit the Bp. of Cambray, probably at Brussels.
Thence he travelled by Antwerp (Ep. 153. ιο) ιο Veere (Ep. 157), and after the
briefest stay went on at once ιο Tournehem (Ep. 157).

‘I'his is the order of events given in Ep. 1573 but a difficulty arises from the
mention in Epp. 154, 5, of circumstances—the length of Erasmus’ visit to
Rouana, and the illness of the bey at Dordrecht-which he would presumably
have mentioned when he visited his correspondents. If, however, the visit ιο
the Bishop is placed before the visit ιο Helland‚ the length of time available for
the latter is curtailed and an interval of a month remains to be filled with the
journey from Ziriczee to Veere and on to Tournehem3 also it is necessary to
