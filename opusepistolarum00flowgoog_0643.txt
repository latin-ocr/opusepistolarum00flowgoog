THE DEVENTER LE'l'rER-BOOK 605

occurring in bundles of leaves which can be distinguished from
one another with apparent ease. Ff. 183-7 for instance seem
plainly to be by a different hand from ff. 188-204. But at
f. 121 the two writings mingle and become undistinguishable‚
the characteristic upstrokes of the one appearing in the same
line, and even in the same word, with those of the other. The
limite of the letters copied by this hand are from 27 May 1509
(Ep. 215) to 11 Nov. 1517⁸ (LB. App. 205).

Among the Erasmiana in the Basle University Library is the
manuscript copy of Erasmus’ translation of Book 11 of Gaza's
Οτι-9111111111, which was sent to Basle in August 1517, and printed
by Froben ⁹; the compositors’ marks on the manuscript to show
the ends of the pages corresponding exactly with the pagos of
Froben’s first edition. It is written by this hand, almost
entirely in the straight form, with corrections in the margin
by Hand 03 which are included, however, in Froben’s text.

2. Hand B, covering ff. 206-224, 205 being blank, the letters
fffiging from 22 Apr. 1517 (LB. App. 130) to 7 Oct. 1517

· App· 19 )·

3, 4. Hands C διξὰ D, covering ff. 1-16 and 30-92‚ with isolated
letters by D on f. 93 v0 and f. 102. The differences between
them are strongly marked, but they are plainly contemporary
with one another, since several letters are begun by one hand
and finished by the other. The range is from 8 July 1517
(LB. App. 146) by D, and 13 July 1517 (LB. 258) by O, to
24 Apr. 1518 (LB. App. 135) by D, and 26 Apr. 1518 (LB. 314, 5)
by O. These two scribes evidently did not accompany Erasmus
to Basle in the summer of 1518.

5. Of Hand E there are only tw0 letters (LB. App. 284, 5) on f. 17.
They are dated 31 May 1518 and are plainly written by some
servant acquired at Basle. In spite of obvious differences, it
may possibly be identified with the next hand, Hovius', for
there are points of resemblance, and the two are hardly farther
apart than the tw0 forms of Hand A. It is noticeable also that
tfivo leaves (ff. 18-9) are lettered ¹⁰ by Hand E but are written ΒΥ

ovius.

6. The next and last hand has some very distinctive marks,
notably the letter d. It covers ff. 18-29, and the letters range
from 13 Aug. to 25 Oct. 1518, consisting almost entirely of
letters written after Erasmus' return to Louvain. In some
scribblings by this hand in the margin of f. 58 the words ⁴ Houus
tuus ’ occur, which are evidently the scribe's own signature; and
he may thus be identified with John Hovius, who entered
