LETTERS TO SERVATIUS, FRANOIS, AND SASBOUD 585

no evidence by which a precise date can be arrived at for these letters,
but they may be assigned conjecturally to the earliest years of Erasmus’
residence at steyn, and arranged in the following order·

Ep. 4. Something occurs to separate Erasmus and Servatius.
Erasmus proposes that they should solace their separation by writing
letters. Servatius replies ιιι a melancholy tone and promises to con-
tinue writing. (The letter is lost.)

Ep. 5. Erasmus seeks to comfort Servatius; he asks the reason
of the change that has come over him and invites his confidence.
fidEp. 6. Servatius does not write ; Erasmus agam' asks for his con·

enee.

Ep. 7. Servatius will not respond to Erasmus’ advances; Erasmus
accuses him of feigning friendship.

Ep. 8. Servatius is still silent ς Erasmus writes more warmly and
repeats the charge of insincerity.

1 Servatiius )replies kindly and protests against the charge. (The
etter is ost.

ΕΡ. 9. Erasmus replies ιιι great delight‚ and explains what had made
him suspect insincerity.

It seems from ΕΡ. 8. 6 that the separation had not been long con·
tinuing at the time when these letters were written.

Ep. ιο stands alone by itself, as an exhortation to study addressed to
:ff friend who is afterwards associated with Ser-vatius in Erasmus’

ection'.

The second group, ΕΡΡ. 11-16, shows Erasmus in the attitude
of a teacher encouraging his pupils to the studies in which
his own interests were concontrated. Epp. 11 and 12 may be placed
together from a certain similarity of language, and so also Epp. 13,
14 and Epp.15, 16, but the tone of all is very much the same.
There is an indication of date in Ep. 15, in which four years are said
to have elapsed whilst Servatius had been hesitating to devote himself
to learning. But this does not necessarily imply that Erasmus had
then been four years at Steyn; and I have therefore thought- it better
to keep this whole series of letters together, rather than place the last
3ιὲιίιὲ in sshte' autumn aff} 1491, after the series to Cornelius in which
a eren ne rev .

1f the letters {re assumed to be genuine, it may be suggested that
the attachment began in the early days of Erasmus’ monastic life ;
and for a time the two friends may have been able through the
liberty allowed to Erasmus to read together, just as Erasmus had
read with Cornelius of Woerden ⁴. But Servat-ius was not an eager
student, and after a time obstacles to their intercourse arose 3 where-
upon Erasmus began to write letters to which Servatius tardily
replied. Subsequently the relation between the two was discovered,
the authorities were dis pl,eased and Servatius came in for some
rebuke⁸ 3after which Erasmus recovered his balance and reverted to
a more solid basis for what was no doubt a genuine affection, in an “
attempt to encourage Servatius' studies.

The‘ pear- ·tree’ incident of Erasmus’ monastic life is related by

‘Lond. xxiv .‚5 1.13. App. 4423 and “Epp. ιι. 7, Band 12. 10-2.
