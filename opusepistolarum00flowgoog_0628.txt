may also have received instruction from Michael of Pavia²⁴. In the
scantiness of information for this period the following passage also
may be quoted, ²⁶ in which Erasmus is speaking of possession by evil
spirits· ‘Mirum est autem quod hic de vna virgine narrat Hierony·
mus3 sed aetate nostra rem vidimus multo prodigiosiorem in fre-
quenti virginum monasterio, quod est in Hannonia, vulgo dictum
Keynout ²⁶. Ea res non mediocriter torquebat humanismmum prae-
sule'm et vere patrem, episcopum cameracensem Hernicum, inter
inclytos illos Berganae stirpis heroas tum natu maximum. Nam
ap ud hunc id temporis admodum iuuenis vinebam. Quae gymnasia
vir ille super hac re non consuluit? Quos non adduxit quos existi-
masset vel eruditione pollere vel sanctimonia ⁶? Nemo non stupefactus
discessit. Nec prius extinctum est hoc malum quam extinctis ad vum
virginibus, quae fuerant a daemone correptae! A full narrative of
this ‘ diabolical pestilence ’ which broke out at Easter 1491, and
lasted for six or seven years is given by Molinet ²⁷. The Bishop
visited the convent οιι 17 April 1491 to inquire into the trouble.

Another glimpse of this period 1s given in a letter from a certain
william of Louvain, an inmate of the Augustinian priory of Groe·
nendaelw in the forest of Zonia near Brussels‚ written to Mai-tin
Lypsius in 1522 or 3, which substantiates the early interest in
Augustino of which Erasmus speaks ιιι 1518²⁹. ‘His libris (Aug-us·
tini) Erasmus noster olim summe delectatus est, cum aetate adhue
iuuenis Bruxella venisset nostram inuisere vallem, et potissimum,
vti reor, bibliothecam. Qua perlustrata istos ex omnibus elegit
libros, quibus tanto inhaerebat studio vt noctibus quoque eos ad
cubiculum sibi pro quiete deputatum ferret. Mirabantur nostri, vt
a senioribus audiui, et paene ridebant hominem, quod illos ferme
solos amplecteretur codices caeterisque praeferret omnibus, nempe
ignari quid ipsum in illis tantopere delectaret ³⁰! It may be noted
that the Bishop of Cambray was one of the benefactore of Groenen·
dael. It is possible also that Erasmus was drawn thither by a monk
of Bergan, Daniel Petri, who afterwards became prior, 1523-1534,
and in that position showed himself a patron of learning and con·
siderably enlarged the library. For fuller details about this period
Mr. Nichols’ vol. i. chap. 3 may be consulted. I do not agree with
his conjecture that Erasmus had met Batt before going to Bergen.
