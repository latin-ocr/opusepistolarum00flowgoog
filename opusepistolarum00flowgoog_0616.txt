Carpentras3 but though mistakes are frequent enough ²⁰ in Sadolet's
Briefs, written out in full in his beautiful handwriting‚ it would be
difficult to write Rogerii for Gerardi. A more probable solution
may be found in the suggestion that Erasmus’ father was named
Rogerius Gerardus, and his grandfather Helias Gerardus, or perhaps
Helias Gerardi. Surnames were then gradually supplanting patro-
nymica 21; so that on this supposition Erasmus might have been
called indifferently Erasmus Rogerii er Erasmus Gerardus. Thus
ErasmuS, or perhaps Sadolet‚ uses in this case the patronymic;
Hei-man at an earlier date, addressing Peter, adopts the sui-name.

The evidence as to his birthplace²· is conflicting, but the balance
is not against Erasmus. In all points, therefore, except the sup·
pression of Peter, I accept the Compendium as a genuine and accurate
document, composed by Erasmus and representing the contributions
which he could, or wished to, make to the knowledge of his life
already possessed by his executore.

APPENDIX ΙΙ

ERASMUS’ EARLY LIFE

Tm: chief sources for our knowledge of Erasmus’ early years are
the compendium Vitae and the letter to Rome ¹, on which the Com-
pendium is based; supplemented by a few indications derived from
elsewhere. Erasmus’ statements as to his own age are numerous
but conflicting; and in consequence his birth has been variously
assigned to any year from 1465 to 1469. The evidence has been
carefully examined by Dr. Richter² and Mr. Nichols ⁹, and both
conclude that the balance of it is strongly in favour of 1466; this
therefore may be accepted as the year which in later life he con·
sidered as that of his birth, but in view of the date at which he left
Deventer and of the uncertainty which he once expresses ⁴, it seems
possible that he was mistaken. He was born during the night ³ of
Oct. 27-8, and to this is due the discrepancy between the statement
in the compendium Vitae and his practice of celebrating his birthday
on the festival of St. Simon and St. J ude. In the same way equally
good authorities ascribe his death to 11 and 12 J uly 1536, because he
died about midnight. For the circumstances of his birth see ii. 1 n.
