[This letter was discovered by M. Paquier‚ and has been printed by him with
some others of 1539 111 1110 Μέῑαηροε d'Arche'oloqio of the Ecole Francaise de Rome,
1895, p. 355. His excellent notes enable the letter to be dated with precision.
'I'he manuscript is not an autogr-aph, but was written by a secretary with
corrections in Aleander's hand. Sign. Nogara of Rome has kindly collated it tor
me, reproducing the original orthography which M. Paquier discards.

Jerome Aleander (13 Feb. 1480—31 Jan. or 1 Feb. 1549) of Motta in Friuli,
NE. of Venice. In 1493 he was sent to school at Venice, and in spite of a
desultor-y and interrupted education succeeded in learning Greek and Hebrew.
In Nov. 1501 he entered the service of Angelus Leoninus‚ Papal Legate at Venice,
and was sent by him on a mission to Hungary. In J an. 1509 110 left the Legate
and returned to Motta ; but in the winter went back to Venice to teach. There
in Aug. 1503 110 became tutor to MarinO, the nephew of Card. Grimani ; but
when his pupil returned to Rome, Aleander went to Padua to study philosophy,
with a young Venetian noble, Maffeus Le0, under his charge. In the prefaces
to the Aldine Homer, which is dedicated to him (1504), he is described as
a student of Arabio and Syriae ; and in 1506 110 was welcomed as a member of
the Neacademia. From 1508-13 he was teaching at Paris University (B.A. 1508,
MA. 1509) with remarkable success; except for an interval, 10 Dec. 1510—
0. 14 June 1511, when he was at Orleans. During this period he took part in a
great number of books published by Gourmont and Badius ( see Omont, Βῶιιω dc
la typoyraphio ‚qv-eoque ὰ Paris, in mim. Soc. Hist. Paris, xviii, 1891, and Paquier in
Rev. d. Quaestione Heraeam, 1898-9); but these were mainly repr-ints of Aldine
editions, and his most original work seems to have been a small collection of
Illum-ium maon-undam virorum . . . sententiae, appended to a anomozoqia which he
edited for Matt. Bolsec, Paris, 99 Dec. 1519. 111 1513 110 entered the
service of Stephen Poncher, Bp. of Paris; but transferred himself in 1514 to
