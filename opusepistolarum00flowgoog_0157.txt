Sed de his latius (quum (quae) de litteris scripsimus edemus) nostra
leges, volente quidem Deo. Ad praesentem locum satis fuerit tetigisse
comoedias Terentiana-eu modo recte legantur, non modo non ad
subuertendos mores, verum etiam ad corrigendos maximopere valere,
certe ad latine discendum plane necessarias iudicauerim. An potius 80
istud ex catholicon, Huguitione, Ebrardo, Papia caeterisque ineptiori·
bus sperare iubebunt ⁴? Mirum vero si his authoribus quis quid
Latine dicat, cum ipsi nihil non barbare locuti sint. Huiusmodi
amplectatur, qui balbutire volet3 qui loqui cupiet, Terentium dicat,
quem Cicero, quem Quintilianus, quem Hieronymus, quem Augustinus, 85
quem Ambrosius et iuuenes didicere et senes vsi sunt ς quem denique
nemo, nisi barbarus, non amauit.

Sed de his satis. Ceterum literas tuas optatissimas accepi, non
inconditas, extra iocum Latiniores quam expectaram3 quae quidem
me cum sua quadam facetia, tum tuo quem plurimum prae se ferunt 90
amore, plurimum delectarunt. ΤΘ amamus, te somniamus, tui vi·

cluding sentences it is possible that a visit of the famous printer Gerard Leeu,
ιο his native town, Gouda, suggested to Erasmus an opportunity or making the
first step open to young aspirante for literary fame, by the inclusion of some
subsidiary and eulogistic composition in a forthcoming book 3 and that accord·
ingly this letter was written sor insertion either in a new edition of Proba, like
Cornelius Gerard’s letter in the third edition of Gaguin’s History (pp. 92 and
148, 9), or in some other publication by Leeu. 1 have examined a great number
cf Leeu's books, and of later editions of Proba without result3 but Leeu
perhaps did not think it worth printing. 11 it should yet be found, it would
be Eramus' earliest printed composition.
