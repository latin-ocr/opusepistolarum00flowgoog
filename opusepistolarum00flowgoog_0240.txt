5 feras et falso necessitatem a me praetentam obiicias. Tum enim
qui rei erat, actoris fiet, et qui iurisdicialia coniecturalis aut certe
definitiuus erit, vt quaeratur quid sit necessitas. Sed vide callidum
defensorem; causam meam ago, nondum in iudicium vocatus, sed
vt nullo accusante, meipso et defensore et iudice absoluar. Bene te

[Subsequent to Whitford's grace (p. 207) but before the visit to 'Pom-nehem,
Bp . 87-9. Batt was now established at the castle of Tournehem, between
Cassis and St. omer, as tutor to the young Adolphus of Veere or Burgundy
(Ep. 93), grandson and heir of Antony ol Burgundy‚ the great Bastard (¹5²¹-

the boy was now in the care of his mother, Anne, daughter an heiress of
Woltart vx of Bor-selon (†1486; de Reiffenberg, p. 166), lord of Veere, an
im rtant staple·town, near Hiddelburg.

ournehem castle was the principal residence of Antony of Burgundy's later
γοα-ις and his position thus 011 the frontier of two kingdoms exposed him to
Frenoh intrigues. For nearly twenty years his loyalty had been suspected3
and 011 15 Jan. 1503 he was charged before a Chapter of the Order of the Golden
Fleeee, to which he had belonged since 1456, of substituting for it the French
Order of St. Michael, which he had received from Char-les vnt. Though he
urged French pressure, he and his relatives were kept under surveillan00 for
some time (Ep. 157. no, 1) 3 and asettlement was not reached until 1504, shortly
before his death (de Reiffenberg, pp. 35, 142, 199, 234-068).

'l'he Iaady Anne (1469 ‘P—Dec. 1518) proved an uncertain patroness to Erasmus
until 1501-12 (Epp. 146 and 172), when she married a second husband, Louis
Viscount Hontfort (†1505) ς and her relations with Erasmus ceased. Gairdner
(Letum aad Papus ot· Hem-y νη, ίὶ. 276) prints a letter to her, dated 3 Mar. 1509,
from James xv of Scotland, to whom her father had been related by marriage.
