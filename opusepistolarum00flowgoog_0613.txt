THE AUTHENTIOITY or THE COMPENDIUM VITAE ‘

Tm: Compendium Vitae Era-emi was first published in 1607 ΒΥ
Paul Merula, Professor of History and Librarian in Leiden University.
It accompanies a letter of Erasmus to his friend and confidant
conrad Goclen, dated 2 Apr. 1524, and also published for the first
time, in which Erasmus, whose health had been failing for some
time, speaks of going in sear of his life and of sending to Goclen
‘totius vitae meae compendium ⁹ for the use of his biographers in
case of his death. The volume to which it is prefixed (0¹) contains
also some unpublished letters of Erasmus, gathered partly from
autographa in Merula’s possession, partly from contributions ΒΥ his
friends, Vulcanius, ScriveriuS, and others. The original manuscript
of the Compendium, according to Merula’s preface (12 N ov. 1606),
had for some time belon ed to Otho Werckman ¹, one of his fellow-
citizens, who had recent y shown it to him; but copies of it had
been known to Merula before in the hands of Scriverius and other
persons whom he names, one of which was said to have been made
from the original when in the hands of a certain Henry Ravestein.
The original itself was still in existence in 1649, when Thysius², who
afterwards became Librarian to the University, mentions it as in
the library of Jerome de Backere, one of the persons named by
Merula3 but since then it has disappeared.

The composition of the compendium is remarkable. It begins
with short, jerky sentences whose subject, Erasmus, is left unmen-
tioned; as it proceeds, the style becomes more connected and more
like Erasmus’ wonted periods, though a number of unusual words
and harsh constructione ⁸ occur. It mentions precise facts about
Erasmus' parentage and early life which are known from no other
source, and it traces his career till his settlemen ⁶ Brabant in 1516.
At this point the narrative closes with the wor s ‘ Caetera sunt tibi
nota ’ ; ’and a short account of his character follows which gradually

are quite correct, except in one notable particular.

A large part of the Conmendium is an abridgement of a letter
written ΒΥ Erasmus to Rome in the autumn of 1516⁴, of the
genuineness of which there can be no doubt, since it was published
