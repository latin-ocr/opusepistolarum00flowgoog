[This fragment is perhaps from a letter written by the Archbishop to invite

›ErasmustoEngland on the accession of Henry vm, cf. Ep. 215· 70, 1. Ep. ²9⁶· 128
mentions a gift from Warham exactly corresponding to that promised here.

It occurs in the Collodmmz of Gerard Geldenhauer of Nymegen, which exista
in manuscript in the Bibl. Royale at Brussels, and has been printed by Dr. Prinsen
(Amsterdam, 1901, pp. 19, 20). The book is a medley, and though there is a
rough attempt at chronological arrangement, no argument can be drawn as to
the date of an item from its position in the book]

[The date is fixed by the death of Henry vn, 21 Apr. ¹509· Ep. 283. 73, 4 shows
that without recognizing the handwriting Erasmus took this letter to be the
work of Ammonius, who was evidently in Lord Mountjoy’s service at the time.
Considering Ammonius’ attainments as a Latin scholar (p. 455), it seems hardly
likely that Mountjoy would have retained him merely as a copyist; so that this
letter is very probably his composition (cf. Ep. 206introd.). In the manuscript
heading cvlmmvs uomoxvs is a correction in Erasmus· hand for unam
annosus, which he had written first (see taoeimile). It follows, therefore, that
