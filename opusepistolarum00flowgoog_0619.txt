ERASMUS’ EARLY LIFE 581

at Emmerich; for Agricola’ s letter ²⁴ to him, written from Groningen
on 20 Sept. 1480, hardly admits of the supposition that Hegius was
then at Deventer, since in that case the two friends must have met
when Agricola passed through on his embassies to Brussels²⁵ ,and
Hegius would not have come to Groningen ιιι search of him during
his absence. Also the Arnold, ‘presbyter et philosophusss to whom
Agricola sends greetings through Hegias, is probably Arnold de
Hildesheim‚ who was at one time master of the school at Groningen²⁶‚
and afterwards held a similar position at Emmerich ²⁷. All this is
in agreement with the Conmendiwm Vitae, which indicates that Hegius
was not at Deventer when Erasmus first went there ’5.

As to the meeting with Agricola certainty is not to be attained.
Erasmus’ estimate of his age quoted above cannot be correct, if 1466
is rightly taken for his birth· -year3 for Agricola did not return from
Italy until 1479. But between 1480 and 1484 Agricola probably
passed through Deventer many times on his way to and from
Groningen. He mentions a visit²'⁹ in Oct. 1480; and in April
1484 he was staying there, perhaps with Hegius³⁰ in the house of
the printer‚ Richard Paffraet. ⁸¹ From the close connexion which
existed in Erasmus’ mind between Hegius and Agricola, whom he
frequently mentions together, 55 there ιε some ground for supposing
that it was on this occasion that he saw the great scholar, whom
he afterwards regarded as the teacher of his own master. A bucolic
poem by Erasmus, entitled Pamphilu-⁴3, was published by Alard of
Amsterdam at Leiden in 1538, with the statement that it was
written when Erasmus was ‘perquam adolescens’ and was study ying
under Hegius at Deventer. It is printed also by Leclerc ³⁸ from

From the part which Alard took in collecting and publishing
Agricola’ s papers 55, it is possible that this was a poem presented
to Agricola on this visit³⁶ and preserved by him; but Alard also
had‘ ιιι his keeping' ιιι 1516 the‘ tyrocinia’ of Erasmus and william
Herman ⁸⁷, a description which suits well with the contents of
Scriverius’ manuscript.
