[See Ep. 210. From the movements of Aldus (cf. Ep. 217) and the use of mco,
it may be conjectured that Bombaeius was making the visit to Siena announced
in Ep. 217 (cf. Ep. 251); and that Fantuzzi is wrong in ucribing the visit to
Erasmus, By 29 Aug. 1511 Bombasius had returned to Bologna (ΑΕ. p. 90 n. ς
vatican MS. 4105, f. 295). For a continuance of the correspondence see Ep. 226. 1.]
