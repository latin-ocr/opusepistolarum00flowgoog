humen tuis ex lit-teris, musarum meumque delicium, Iohannes
Paludane, id quod et sine litteris facile comedebam, vt es mei
nominis vel meipso studiosior, te 'iamdudum sitienter expectare
Panegyriei nostri iam emergentis in lueem quasique naseentis quod
5 tandem fatum, quis genius fore videatur. Vix dum prima pagella
recens et adhue ab officina madens coeperat ostentari atque (vt fit
in re noua) aliis ab aliis per manus tradi; Erasmus interim, quem
scis quantopere semper delectarit Apelles ille post tabulas latitans,
nusquam non auree arrectas habebat, vndique captans, non quam
10 multis placeret (quum mihi quidem ad eonscientiae fiduciam et vnius
hominis iudicium abunde sufficiat, modo is vel Valasci nostri vel tui
similis sit), sed qua parte displieeret. Nam laudator, nisi eximie
doetus, officit quoque; at reprehensor etiam parum eruditus aut
admonet quod te suffugerit, aut ad defensionem recte dictorum exper-
¹3 gefaeit, et aut doctiorem facit aut certe reddit attentiorem. Proinde
dispeream nisi mihi Momum vnum malim sanus quam deeem
