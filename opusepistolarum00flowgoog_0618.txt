accord ; and even the calculation suggested, that he was at Deventer
for about five years, is quite at variance with the facts.

As Erasmus was a pupil of Regius, his departure from Deventer
cannot be placed earlier than Hegius’ advent as headmaster in 1483.
The date of this event has been the subject of much controversy ¹⁸
and is usually set much further back; but the year here assigned
may be accepted as correct. It is found in an anonymous life of
Agricola ¹⁹ written in form of a letter to Melanchthon, by some one
who was present when with great emotion Hegius read out before
the school the letter announcing Agricola's death ²⁰. confirmation
for it is supplied by a letter of Agricola, in which he sends his
good wishes to Hegius for his projected opening of the schoola at
Deventer, but warns him that after the ravages of the plague -by
which the town has been devastated he will find the school thinly
attended ²². The letter has no date of month or year, but can be
placed with reasonable certainty in the autumn of 1483. ²⁸ There
is also evidence to show that a few years earlier Hegius was still

’⁰ The date given for this scene in the

died on 27 or 28 Oct. 1485, and the

cola’s friend and patron, who had been
elected Bp. of Worms 111 Aug. ¹48⁶,
and who, in the autumn of that year,
had persuaded Agricola to come and
teach at Heidelberg (see p. 106). with
this may be compared a passage from
a letter οἱ Agricola to Theodoric of
Plenningen‚ a member of Dalberg's
household‚ dated from Groningen,
6 Feb. 1483 ε ‘ Venirem ad vos vel inter
proximos dies, nisi transportandorum
librorum mihi molestia esset ' (Am-ie?

spring of 1483 Henry had by false
representatione insinuated himself
into Dalberg¹s confidence, and might
well have been sent on the mission
here mentioned ς 888 Morneweg, Jokaum
von Dalbeaey, 1887, p. 79. Fui-ther con-
firmation may be found in the mention
of Agricola as in the service of the
town of Groningen (see p. 106). The
familiar way in which Henry is spoken
of may be contrasted with the passage
in which he is introduced to Regius
in the letter of 80 Sept. 1480, and
plainly implies a later date. 'nne

had ,been seen at Antwerp perhaps

town council of Antwerp to Agricola
in the autumn of 1482, that he should
come and preside over the town school;
