appears as Erasmus first composition, written‘ ruri Parrisiis ante annos xxiiiil
ι495 may therefore be assigned as the date of the poem and the letter. A con·
firmatim of this is that the book also contains Erasmus' poem ‘ad θασιιὲπιιηι
nondun visum, 'and must therefore be prior ιο the Sylva odarum (9ο Jan. ι497;
Ep. 49) in which is the poem de suis sat-'c ad Gayuinum cibi amicissimum. In ῙΛισ.
lad. and i. p. 3 these two poema are enumerated as Erasmus* second and third
mpositions.1·'or further consideration· see the note οιι Boece, and also cf.
Bp. 59. ι8. Knight' s statement (Life astruamus, App. p. 16) that th’e De σασα was

composed‘ in compliment to the College of the virgin Μαι-γ at Oxford‚ where
he sojourned’ is plainly an error. The poema, but not the letter, were after·

warda printed with Erasmus’ Epion-ammata. Merula cannot have had the book
before him3 Bobut must have printed from an inferior HS. copy.

Boece orBo s (c.1465-1536) was afterwards first Principal of King 'a college,
Aberdeen, an wrote a History of Scotland and other works. See DNB. He was

BA. at Paris 1493· ua. 1494, and Proctor of the German nation ι495-6. There
is no definite evidence of his being at Aberdeen before 9ο Aug. 1500, when a
document was signed in his preoence (Bait, Um‘v. osAberdocn, p. 30)3 but the
Bun of Alexander vx for the foundation of Aberdeen University ia dated

ιο Peb.149} (ibid. p. 94) and in his Epiacum-m Aberaonmoium Vitae (p. 88,
ed. noh-,1899 Boece mentions Erasmus as one of the learned men in Montaigu

at the time when mphinstone took him from Paris ιο King⁰ ng's 0011 If this
statement can be pressed, Boece' s departure must be placed before ΕΘ, esummer
of 1496, when Erasmus lest Montaigu (p. 158) and possibly about this very time· ‚
for the fact that Erasmus dedicated his first book, not to the Bp. of cambray
to whom his allegiance was due, but ιο an obscure Scotch friend, suggests that
he may just then have had hopes of an introduction ιο Boece' s more liberal
patron Elphinstone, and thus of finding his way to aberdeen. An autograp h
letter of Boece, dated 96 May 1528,ss in the Town library at Breslau (cod.
Bhed. 954. 31) in which he reminds Erasmus of their intercoume in Montaigu
thirty· ·two years before. Erasmus' answer, dated 15 Har. 1530, is prefixed to
his last catalogue of his writings3 which is printed in his comitatio do bello
Tum& mundo, Basle, Froben, ι 530.

It is possible that the epistola mm addressed to 'Robert <Fi-her Ῥ) and dated
from cathale, 30 Nov, (1496 P), which is printed in Siberch's edition of the
Dc Oonoerib. Epist. (ff. 3-4) and speaks of the foundation of a university, may
represent a genuine one from Boece on his Journey ιο Aberdeen. A great many
of the e pistolary examples in the treatise are reminiscences of actual letters,
aee ΕΡ. 71. For the letter here referred ιο, the mma: epistola, in which

Erasmus nai-rates with great fidelity his English experiences in 1499-1500, was
