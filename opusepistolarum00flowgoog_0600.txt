ν Ago nunc in arce Hammensi, pauculos dies cum meo Montioio
commoraturus, deinde Germaniam aditurus in transitu salutatis
30 amiculis aliquot. Si fortuna respondebit et meis optatis et aliorum
promissis, maturabimus reditum; sin minus, consilium ex re capie-
mus. Faxit Deus Opt. Max. vt incolumis reuersus Ammonium
meum offendam non solum incolumem, verumetiam lautissimis
fortunae muneribus auctum. Si quando inciderit occasio prouehendi
35 100 Erasmi tui, non dubito quin sis eum praestaturus absenti quem
semper hactenus praestitisti et absenti et praesenti. Bene vale,
amice singularis.

⁷ [This letter was never published by Erasmus, though copies of it were in
circulation before his death. Two manuscripts of it exist, 0110 111 0 xvi⁰ hand,
in the Athenaeum Library at Deventer (11), the other, written by Martia Lypsius
(1492-1555), in the Bibliotheque Royale at Brussels (β). There are also three
printed versione os importance. Two of these 0011111111 1110 101101 only, on four
quarto leaves, with the title Erami Romodami Epistola qua se 1010110111 cur maurit
monasticam vitam, item habitum, but without indication of date or printer3 os
one, which has an elaborate border and device 011 1110 title-page, there is a copy
, 111 1110 librar-y of Trinity College, Dublin (7¹); of the other, which is quite plain,
several copies are known, one being 111 1110 Bodleian (γ’). The third was printed
by J. Lambert at Ghent in 1536 after Erasmus’ death, with the title Epssua
quaedam D. Erasmi Rot. nunquam ants hac aedita, rationem sm totius vitae 01118 contium.
Epitaphia nonnulla in eundem (δ) ; a copy of this is at St. J ohn's college, Oxford.
Though it is not invariably the best, Ι consider ιι 1110 111081 1011101110, as
containing the important reading inclinatus (l. 54 ; 800 facsimile). Itis the last
item in a little book os twelve octavo leaves, written throughout by the 001110
hand, but plainly 011 00νο101 occasions 3 for the title ⁴ Papa modernus’ is given
to Leo x in an entry of 1515 (f. 5 v0) and to Adrian v1 in one of 1522 gf. 6).
The book contains nine miscellaneous speeches and letters, of dates ranging
between 1508 and 1522. Four 01· 1110 1011018 010 10 and from Erasmus, one of the
latter being unpublished. β 10 0100 of high value and has 1110 following 111110-
1111011011 by Lypsius‚ which throws light on the manner in which the letter
became public property3 ‘ Sequentem epistolam amiculi cuiusdam opera vsus
transcripsi. Erasmus enim ceu sub fide Francisco Nouiomago crucifero,
D. Philippi Traiectensis episcopi sacellano, eam communicarat, sed tandem a suae
professionis consorte circumuentus est, qui eam noctu exscripsit) It 0001110 111
0 MS. volume of 267 quarto leaves, all 111 Lypsius' hand 3 and from the date of
the other contents of the volume it seems to have been written about 1518.
7} and γ’ are probably unauthorized· impressions of the letter, which were in
circulation in 1533, 01111 10 which Erasmus refers as ‘ ea (epistola) quae fertur
ad Sei-uatium ⁹ in Lond. xxvii. 22, LB. 1265. They agree very closely in their
text, 01111 0110 10 probably a reprint of the other. δ 10 unique in containing
versione of a few words and sentences into inferior Greek. One of these passages,
ll. 75-7, is alluded to by Erasmus in the same letter 00 having given offence3
it is clear therefore that the Greek translations were inserted by 801110 friend
os Erasmus in an attempt to establish 011 authorized text of the letter and 10
render passages which were liable to misrepresentation less easily accessible
