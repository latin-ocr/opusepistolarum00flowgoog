John Fisher (14599-22 June 1535) was at this time a patron from whom

Erasmus had much ιο hope. After rising ιο 110 Master of his college, Michael-
house at Cambridge, in 1497, he attracted the notice of the Lady Margaret
Tudor, and was apgointed her confessor. He was vioe-Chaucellor of the
University, 1501, an Chancellor 1504-35 ς and through 1110 influence the Lady
Margaret instituted Professorships of Divinity at Oxford and Cambridge and
founded two Colleges, Christ's and St. John’s‚ to be the 110100 ot the Now
Learning 111 Cambridge. He was appointed Bp. of Rochester 1504, and was Presi-
dent os Queens' College, Cambridge 1505-8. For his patronage of Erasmus in
isos-6 see App. ⁶3 in 15¹2 he proposed ιο take him as his secretu-y to Rome
(Ep. 252). At this time the negotiatione for the foundation os St. J ohn's College
were still continuing, its charter having been granted on 9 Apr. 1511 ς but the
College was not completed until 1516. Fisher remained Erasmus’ friend and
supporter for long, but in later years their relations were perhaps somewhat
