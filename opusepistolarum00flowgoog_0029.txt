Catalogns omnium Erasini Lucubrationum. Basle.
LB. i. init. 30 January 15²3·

[This catalogue, which was written by Erasmus at the request of the friend to
whom it is addressed, is of the highest importance for the study of his life and
works. The first and second editions (a and β) were published by Froben in
April 1583 and Sept. 1584, 1118 second being greatly enlarged; a third, corrected,
appeared from the same prees c. Feb. 1537 (γ) 3and the treatise, again 18118811,
18 included among the introductory matter in the first volume of Erasmus'
opera Omnia, 1540 (δ). 11 18 811 expansion of the Lucubratiomlm Era-ami Rota-adami
Index, printed by Th. Martens, 1 Jan. 1519, doubtless from information fur-
nished by Erasmus himself, who was then at Louvain; and reprinted with
additions by Froben, 89 March 1519, and in modern times by F. L. Hoffmann,
Serapeum, 1868. 49 etc. and 1863. 11. It is noticeable that the date of the letter
18 retained unchanged in β, 111 spite of the insertion 111 the text of dates which
plainly contradict it. The history of Erasmus' numerous writings may be studied

101111 von Botzheim (c. 1480-Apr. 1535) belonged to a noble Alsatian family
domiciled at Sasbach‚ east of Strasburg. He was a pupil of Wimpfeling at Heidel-
berg, and some verses by him appear in wimpfeling's Adolescentia, first published
in 1499 (Kneflper, Wimgselinq, pp. 119, 80). 111 1500, being already a vicar of
Strasburg cat edral, he matriculated at Bologna (Acta Nat. Germ. Unic. Bonan.
p. 857), where he became Doctor of Canon Law. He returned froin Italy to
strasburg in 1504, bringing with him Lorenzo Astemio’s edition of the Dc vitis
Caesarum of Aurelius Victor (Fano H. Soncinus, 86 Feb. 1504), which was
at once reprinted by Thos. Wolf tfie younger at Strasburg, Jo. Prile. 11 Mar.
1505. He also published with the same printer Roda-ici zamorensis speculum vite
sumam, 18 Jan. 1507. 111 1518 118 was appointed Canon of constance, where 1118 ,
house soon became a centre of hospitality for 111811 of art and lettere, and for
travellers passing to Tyrol and Italy. He was introduced to Erasmus by Urbanus
Rhegius in ¹520 (Lond. xii. 38, LB. 248; wrongly dated 1517). Similarity of
temperament made them close friends3 and in Sept. 1522 Erasmus visited
him for a few weeks from Basle. He was at first favourably inclined to the
Reformation, but afterwards revolted from its excesses, and thus, like Erasmus,
found both parties hostile to him. In 1587, when reform triumphed at
Constance, 118 accompanied the Cathedral Chapter to Ueberlingen and remained
there till 1535, when he went to Freiburg on a visit to Erasmus, during which
he died. He adopted the name Abstemius or Bivilaqua, either from admiration
of the Italian humanist, or in indication of his temperate habits; it appears as
early as 1507 in the Speculum cite humane. Otmar Nachtgall's onqymnasmata Graecae
Lite-ramae, Strasburg‚ J o. Knoblouch, 1581, 818 dedicated to him.
