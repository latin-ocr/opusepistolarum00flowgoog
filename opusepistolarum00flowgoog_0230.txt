De conscribendis Epistolis (1521) fo, A* ν’. (Paris.)
(March 1498 ?)

'l'he preface to an original draft of the De Censeo-ttondit epistolis, first published
at Cambridge in 1521 by J. Siberch, who states in a prefaee ιο John Fisher,
Bp. of Bochester, a kinsman of R. Fisher, that the book was printed from
a copy made by a friend some years before from Erasmus' own manuscript. The
publication was without Erasmus' knowledge ; and on hearing of it he at once
issued an authorized edition (Basle, Froben, Aug. 1522) 111 which for this
preface is substituted one to Nicholas Berauld, dated 25 May 1522 (Lond. xxix. 11 ε
LB. 1. 343). At the same time the book was enlarged and revised, 11οι1ιὶοω
names being put in place of real ones; e. g. Trebonius or Lucius for Erasmus,
Praepositura Corinthiensis for Episcopatus Senensis, Sogdianus for Scotus.

From these two prefaees of Erasmus it is plain that 110, wrote the treatise for
Fisher, who at the time was just starting for Italy. The composition was com-
pleted in two days after nearly three weeks’ preparation, Erasmus inserting any
thing that came into his head and, in particular, passages from his own and his
friends’ letters ; see Epp. 61, 70, and 81, and cf. p. 155. The letter (LB.
i. 453) from Santeranus (cf. App. 5) to Faustus is perhaps a genuine one
brought back from Bergen after the visit in 14963 in 1522 Antonius was
substituted in it for the name Erasmus. A copy of the treatise was made by
Augustine, from whom Erasmus obtained it with difficulty (Ep. 8ο. 23 seq.), to
be revised in the spring of 1499 for dedication to Adolphus of Veere (Epp. 94-5).
In England it was sent to Lord Mountjoy (Ep. 117) 3 but 011 returning to Franco
Erasmus again proposed to dedicate it to Batt's pupil (Epp. 130. 94 and 145. 155).
At this time was added a mixta epistola dated from Orleans 5 Dec. (1593
in which Erasmus' journey from London to Paris is unmistakably deseri
and the capture of Lodovico il Moro by the French (10 April 1500) alluded to.
It was resumed again at Cambridge in 1511 (Ep. 241), probably with a view ta)
publication ; but it was laid aside for more important tasks, and Erasmus does
not seem to have touched it again until 1522.

Fisher’s departure to Italy may be placed between Epp. 70 and 723 and
therefore in the spring of 1498. Mr. Nichols puts it later on the ground ofa long ·
exemplum narrationis (Siberch f. 71 v0), in which the death of Charles vm (7 April
1498) is evidently referred to. But the letter contains a number of inaccuracieg
and is suppressed in the authorized edition of 1522; it is perhaps the ‘prolixa
epistola in qua nullum est verbum meum, insigniter insulsa nec quicquam
faciens ad praesens argumentum,' which Erasmus describes Fisher as inserting
(Lond. xxvii. 42 ; LB. 1295). Such a description hardly suits the present
preface, which may therefore be accepted as genuine. Δ

It is noticeable that one of the passages inserted from Erasmus’ correspondence
is from a letter of Dec. 1498, Ep. 81. The copy from which Siberch printed
must therefore have been made after one of the later revisions, perhaps that of
1499, which 18 likely ιο have been· interrupted by Erasmus departure to
England3 for the retention of the preface to Fisher shows that the treatise
cannot have been ready for dedication to Adelphus.]
