there his first action was to obtain the promotion which he had
abandoned at Cambridge ⁷.

In this connexion Erasmus’ proficiency in Greek may be con·
sidered. He had learnt the rudiments of it at Deventer ’ς but his
facilities for studying it cannot have been many, and whilst at steyn
he still probably found it somewhat of an achievement to write the
character, if we may judge from the fact that he headed one of lus
odes with Cornelius’ name written in Greek ⁹. In Paris he doubtless
took what opportunities he could, and his letters as early as 1496¹⁰
show a tendency to quote from the Greek. The motive which led
him in 1499 to decline Colet’s invitation ¹¹ to stay in Oxford and
lecture was probably that he could find none there to teach him
Greek. On returning to Paris he applied himself to the tongue mth
all his energies ¹², being convinoed of its importanoe ¹³ and readyto
make any sacrifice for it. At Orleans in the autumn of 1500 he πρε
working hard at Homer, whom he still found some difficulty m

however, he was grievously disappointed ¹⁶. In Epp. 143 and 149 h1⁸

In the summer of 1501 he is clamouring for new Greek books, and ’

there is the first hint of translation ¹⁷.

His determination ¹⁸ was rewarded. By the time he reached ¹
