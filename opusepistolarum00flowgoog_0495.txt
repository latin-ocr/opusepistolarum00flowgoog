Mariae Encomium <151 1 >, Tit. v0. <Paris 2²)
Lond. xxix. 55: LB. iv. 401. 9June<1511).

[Thep refaoe to the nortae Enoemium, the first edition of which was published
by Gilles Gourmont at Paris without date (a). and reprinted by Sohiirer at
Strasburg ιιι Aug. 1511 and Oct. 15125 by Th.11artens at Antwerp,Jan.1512;
and by Badius ιιι Paris, ⁹7 July 1512.No changes occur in the prefaee ιιι these
reprime, although in Badius' the Mor-ia is deseri as‘ rursus ab ipso Erasmo
recognita: It was revised however for Schiirer’ s edi ιιοιι of N0v1514 (β>; which
was followed, except for trifling differences of spelling, by Froben' s editions of
May and (Autumn 1515), Nov. 1517, Nov. 1519. Oct. 1521, and by Schiirer' ι of
Dec.1517, and June 1519.A commentary by Get-ard Listrius is added to the
first (May 1515) and all ςιιιοιεκιιιειιιι. Froben editions.

The history of the composition of the Μονία has been obseured by the want of
date in the first edition and by an impossible y‚ear·date 1508, which is added
to the preface for the first time in the Frobeny edition of July ¹5²⁹ (γ), and ιι
retained in all subsequent issues. Erasmus wrote the Πονια ιιι More's house
immediately after his return from Italy, whilst awaiting the arrival of his books
(Lond. xxxi. 4ο, LB. ix. 3 na ι Adeo. 1140: and i. p. 19. g(5), but did not publish
it at once. 'l'he mouth-date preventa any earlier year than 1510, since in any
case Erasmus could not have returned from Rome by 9 June 1509 after receiving
Ep. ²¹5 ς and it has been shown (Ep. 216 inti-od.) that his settin out from Rome
cannot be placed before July. But in Lond. minu, LB. ix. 3 ι, ιιι declares
that the Moris was reprinted several times within a few months3 and even
without this statement it is impossible to suppose that if it appeared in June
1510, it should not have been reprinted until Aug. 1511. 1⁵11 may therefore be
accepted as the date of the first issue.

Erasmus went to Paris to ses it through the prees (i. p. 19. 8 ; and see a letter
of Stephen Gardiner, Breslau MS„ Ood. Rehd. 254. 68, printed in the Αοαάοηις,
ι9 Oct. 1895) ; and his statement that it was published by Richard Oroke may be
taken as another example of a polite fiction in the cause of modesty; cf. p. ιιι.
His referenoe' ιιι i to the incorrectness of the first edition is borne out by the
fact that it contains two and a quai-ter pagos of Corrigenda at the end. y'l'he
signature‘ Ex rure 'which has been thought to denote More' s house at chelsea,
may be compared with that of Ep. 47, and perhaps indicates a visit to friends in
the neighbourhood of Paris, such as the Abbey of St. Germain des Ριόι, the
home of his friend James Faber of taples. Erasmus had been staying with
More, however, just before the visit to Paris (ΕΡ. 218 introd. ). The position of
the preface' ιιι the first edition shows that it was already eomposed when the
printing of the book began.

The statement in More' s letter to Dorp, dated αι Oct. (1515) (Lond. Mori Epist.
ο, LB. App. 513, 19¹⁹ r), that the Maria had then been‘ iam plus annis sep tem
septies. ‚excusa ’is plainly impossible. «Septem perhaps arose from a confusion
in writing between iiii and vii. This sentence of More· s may be the origin of

Oroke (Ep. 227), who was now in Paris not uncommon term. Erasmus uses it
and eorrecting the Koria for the presa of himself for his abundant writing
(i. p. ¹9· 8); and interprets the next (nond.i.1o,1,13.221); anditiaapplied
