606 APPENDIX VIII

Erasmus’ service at Basle in the summer of 1518 and remained
with him for some years. The other hands I am not able to
identify, but one is probably that of John Smith, who was in
Erasmus’ service at intervals between 1512 and 1518¹¹.

The composition and arrangement of the manuscript also help to
elucidate its history. The scribes used loose sheets of paper folded
in two, and the first two hands, A and B, adopted the practice of
grouping the sheets together in signatures, A, B, C, δια, like a
printed book, each group containing 4 or 5 sheets, forming 8 or 10
leaves. Most of the leaves are now separate, but a few sheets still
remain uncut, and originally they were doubtless all so ; for not only
do the groups consist invariably of an even number of leaves, half of
which have a watermark, generally the same throughout each group,
and half not ς but also ff. 203-4 are out of place through some error
of the scribe, Hand A, who having gone straight from f. 202 to f. 204
was unable to rectify the mistake by rearrangement of the leaves,
but was obliged to write on f. 202 a note directing the render to
f. 204.

When the volume increased in size, Hand C or Hand D made anew
numeration, numbering the leaves in the top right hand corner from 1
to 206¹2, now ff. 46 to 224, with the blank leaf at the end of the
book. The first 53 of these leaves are in Hands C and D, containing
the earlier letters written by them 3 but the remainder are by A and
B. It is noticeable, however, that ff. 36-9 are numbered 54·7‚
and that f. 102 also in D’s hand forms a second 62. It appears,
therefore, that Hand C or D originally carried its numeration at
least as far as 62 with leaves written by itselt, but subsequently
mislaid or discarded its own leaves 54 and onwards and continued
with the large blocks written by A and B. On the later written leaves.
ff. 1—45, there are two numerations by Hand E, ff. 1-19 being lettered
with the Roman alphabet, d-y, and ff. 30-45 with the Greek, βῬν
in addition to the numbers 54—7, which, as already stated, appear ⁰1¹
g. 36-9, whilst ff. 20-9, the work of Hovius, have no older numera·

on.

These various considerations make it possible to determine With
accuracy the date and composition of the Deventer letter-book- At
some time in the summer of 1517, after the publication of ARQW‘
&stole sane quam elegantes, Louvain, Th. Martem, April 1517 (0¹),
Erasmus gave to two of his servants, A and B, a number of letters
from his friends to be copied, including a few of comparatively early
date from England. In the autumn these servants left him and two
new ones, C and D, carried on the book, now mainly with Erasmus
own letters, until he went to Basle for the summer months of 15¹3·
By them the book was arranged and the leaves numbered. At 3²⁸1?
Hovius, and perhaps another pupil before him, entered Erasmus
service, and besides making a few additions added two syfllssmss οἱ
lettering to complete the arrangement. Finally, after Erasmus’ mtufn
to Louvain and recovery from the plague, the budget of 10ttegs ¹¹¹
