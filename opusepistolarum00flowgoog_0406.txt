who found a livingin the Medici court

31. Vuatensi] The Provost, or Abbot‚
of an Augustinian abbey in the village
of Watten, which lies five miles distant
fmm 81. 011101· 011 1110 Calais road. The
list of Abbots given in GC. iii. san-5
is deficient at 11118 point.

163. 3. Adrianus] Perhaps a Francis·
can. See Ep. 166. For the Franciscan
settlement at St. Omer see J. De·
rheims, Hist. de la Villo de St. omer. p. 594.

Gudianus] The title of the head
of a Franciscan convent. The Warden
here mentioned can be identified with·
out difficulty with John vitrarium a
Franciscan for whom Erasmus soon
felt a great admi ration, cf. ΕΡ. 165. 3, 13,
and of whom he afterwards wrote a
short sketch in a letter, Lond. xv. 14,
LB. 435. Τ1118 has been carefully
translated and edited as The Lives os
Jekan Vitrier and John dolet, by ΜΓ. J. Β.

from the sermons of John Viti-arius, a
Franciscan of Touruay‚ see d'Argentre’s
Collodio Iudiciorum, i. pt. a, pp. 340, 1. He
identifles the two pensons and suggests
that Vitrarius was transferred, accord-
ing to the regular Franciscan practice,
from Tournay to St. 0111οι- 111 the
interval; a view which is borne 0111
by these letters, since the distrust 11010
expresse&- which has already 1118-

acquaintance. Very little is known
of his life, beyond the informationi
given in Erasmus’ letter: which men·
tions struggles with the Sum-agan
Bishop of Boulogne §see p. 303), and
a visit to Colet 111 Eng and. It appears
from 1110 same source that his strietness
as Warden led -to his deposition and
transfer to be Confessor to a nunnery
nearCourtrai. Ini.p.2o,theMiridion
