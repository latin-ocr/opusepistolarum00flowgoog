594 APPENDIX VII

fortunately survives to throw light on the practice of Erasmus, and
doubtless of his contemporaries, in this matter, having found a home,
after many vicissitudes, in the Athenaeum Library at Deventerf.
The care with which Erasmus usually preserved his writings is
shown, however, by the address to his readers, added to the last col·.
lection of letters published by him (M), from which it appears that
shortly before he had examined the accumulatione of his papers and
expected ιο find among them some of the writings of his youth still
surviving ⁸.

Erasmus’ first essay at publication was on his return ιο Basle in
August 1515. Finding that Froben had a miscellaneous volume (A)
in the prees, he took the opportunity to print with great amplifica·
tions three imfflrtant letters, to which, for some unexplained reason,
he wished to assign corrected dates, and also an apology for the
Μανία, which had recently been attacked with some ability by 8
young professor at Louvain.

In the following year, while staying at Antwerp with his intimate
friend Peter Gilles, he had a small selection from his correspon-
dence, the &istola αά Emsmmn (B), printed, a preface being contri·
buted by Gilles, who represents himself as being responsible for the
publication. As the title implies, the greater part of the letters (four-
teen out of twenty-one) are by Erasmus’ friends; and there is no
ostensible sign of his complicity, although to his intimatos he made
no attempt to conceal it ⁹. It was natural enough for an author to
assume modesty about the merite of his own compositions ¹⁰ and 11¹
similar volumes of that period it is common to find an introductory
letter, apologizing with more or less fervour for the publication, and
attributing it ιο the pressure of friends.

The next volume, the Epistola ezeqantes (C), divided about
equally between Erasmus and his correspondents was also fatherefi
by Peter Gssles, who again assumes in his preface sole responfll·
bility. But a note ¹¹ from Rutger Roscius, who was correcting fql'
Martens’ press, about a difficulty in one of the letters, milk& ¹⁶
quite clear that Erasmus had a hand in the publication, and ssh⁹
book itself revealed ¹² that he was a guest in Gilles' house not long
before the preface was written. In spite of this, Erasmus thought ’ᾗ
worth while to pretend some months later ¹³ that the book had bfffln
made up in his absence, and to protest a reluctance ιο its pubhoa·
tion which he very possibly felt.

Again‚ the editor of the Auctarium (D), Beatus Rhenanus, who was
Erasmus' trusted friend and loyal fellow·worker, represents himself
as privately culling some letters from Erasmus’ sheaves of eorresPffl·
dence and publishing them aster their writer’s departure f⁰¹'
Louvain. But, in fact, Erasmus had contemplated a new volume ⁰f
letters, and began making preparatione for it before he set out f⁰¹'
Basle in the spring of 1518 ¹⁴. He did not, however, actually SUW‘
vise the printing; and in consequence some passages were included
which had afterwards to be excised.
