5. de Hacqueuille] Nicholas de Hac·
queville († Dec. 1500), Canon of Notre
Dame and member of the Parliament
of Paris in 1482. From Dec. 1490 till
his death he was President of the
Chamber of Inqueets. He was so
strongly impressed by the success of
Hauburn's work at Chateauffiandon,
that in the spring of 1497 he persuaded
the Parliament and the Bp. of Paris
10 write to the General Chapter of the
windesheim congregation for men to
reform the Abbey of St. Victor. In
June 1499 he supported Standonck's
first attempta to obtain new statutes
for Montaigu. He received the Abbey
of Livry, a. 1ο Feb. 1499, ‘in com·
mendam‚’ and prepared it for the re-
forms carried out by Mauburn. See
GC. vii. 836, 111 which his death is
wrongly placed 011 6 Jan. 15023

9. Standonck John Standonck,
often Standouc , († Jan. 1504), the
reformer of the College of Montaigu.
He was born at Mechlin, and was
admitted 10 1110 Sorbonne c. 24 Dec.
1480, being already a Bachelor of
Theology. On 12 May 1483 he was
appointed Principal of Montaigu, 111011
entirely in decay. By taking in rich
pupils he obtained revenues to main·
tain the Domus Pauper-um, which
Erasmus entered, and through his

9. Stsndouch (ιβ.

influence the college buildings were
restored. From 16 Dec. 1485-17 Har.
1486 110 was Rector of Paris Univer-
sity. In the summer of 1499 110 was
banished from Paris by Leuis m for
his resistance to the royal divoree and
for being concerned in the tumults
which followed the king's abridge·
ment of certain University privileges ς
cf. LB. App. 378. 17⁶9 cn. He with·
drew to Louvain (Ep. 135) but was
allowed to return by royal letters
dated 17 Apr. 1500, and resumed his
interrupted endeavours to obtain a
new set of statutos for Montsigu.
He was completely successful, the new
statutes being ratifled by the Dean
and Chapter of Notre Dame 011 13 3011.
1501. His inssuence was widespread‚
in the direction of reforma enabling
poor studente to attend the Univer-
sities. 0οΠοςοε for this purpose are
attributed to him st Louvain‚ the
former Collegium Porci, 0. 14 (cf.
p. 160), 1100111111, Dec. 1500, alen-
ciennee in Hainault, by G. Mol-ingus
(Vita Haemum· Sati, Louvain, Rescius,
Νον. 1536, 1³⁶.13·); andalsoat Cambray.
Possibly they were founded on his
model; just as his new statutos were
imitated freely in other universities.
Erasmus describes him as a man of
enthusiasm, but lacking in judgement
(Ιολϋινορὴαρία, LB. i. 806 cmg and
this is borne out by Ra. Ε. See
Bulaeus, Hist. Univ. Paris, v· 830, 834
and 9oo; Felibien‚ Hm. dePan's, i. 528—
