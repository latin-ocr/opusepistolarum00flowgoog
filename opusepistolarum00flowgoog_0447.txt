Enmvsao, Erasme disertissime, non possum candido tuo atque
graui de Valla nostro iudicio non subscribere; vt enim nullius aeque
censentis inuidiam, ita studiosorum omnium non infimam et gratiam
et beneuolentiam meruit. Nam si, vt de doctrina Christiana recte
sentit diuus Augustinus, in vna lingua subobscura et clausa ex 5
alterius collatione fiunt illustria et aperta, quae tandem inuidia si
eos locos in quibus Latina exempla ab Graeco exemplari modo dis·
crepant, modo etiam frigent, in medium afferat ⁴? nisi id illi forsan
inuidemus, quod tanto nos labore leuarit. Sed nolo stomachari;
spero enim fore vt venatio tua omnibus diuinae lectionis studiosis, ιο
vt est gratissima, ita sit et iucundissima. Vale.

[Erasmus was probably only once (E . ¹71 introd.) in Paris between the sprin
of 1501 and the autumn of 1504, and ere is no evidence to show that he ha
met Gilles before 1504 3 so that 1505 is the earliest date to which this letter can
be assigned. There is no subsequent year in which it can be placed except 1510,
since Gilles published Agricola’s opuscula on 31 Jan. 1511 (cf. mm.. Apr. 1906).
But 151ο is somewhat late for Gilles to have been a student ; and Erasmus was
then probably in England. Some confirmation for the position here assigned is

given by the mention of Valla.
Peter Gilles (1486-7—11 Νον. 1533) was the son of Nicholas Gilles of Antwerp.

His acquaintance with Erasmus may have beffln earlier, but certainly dates
from 1504, when Erasmus was at Antwerp for the printing of the Panem
(Ep. 179), Gilles being at the time a corrector for Th. Martens' presa, in which
he had recently supervised the printing of the Lucubratiuneulae (Ep. 164). It is
not known whether he came to Paris on this occasion, but his studies were
probably directed towards the law. In 151ο he was appointed chief Secretary
to the town of Antwerp, but continued for some years to work for Har-tens ι for
whom he edited the Epistles of Politian (1510), the works of Rud. Agricola (1511),
some versions of Aesop's Fables (1513). which included those of Hermen of
Gouda (Ep. ¹72· 12 n), the Par-abdas of Erasmus (1515), two collectione (Β and C)
of Erasmus· Epistola (1516 and 7 and More’s Utopia (1516), the first edition
of which is dedicated to him; an in 1518 he edited some dialogues of Lucian
for Hillen at Antwerp. He compiled also a legal treatise, Summo . . . layum diuer-
sorum imperatorum (Louvain, Th. Max-tens, 1517). 'l'hroughout his life Erasmus
remained his close friend and adviser.
