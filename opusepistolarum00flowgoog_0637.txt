PRINCIPAL EDITIONS OF ERASMUS’ EPISTOLAE 599

rejected. He was assisted perhaps by De la Faye, who afterwards
worked up the Deventer letter-book ³⁸. The letters were printed
with care, the basis being apparently the London text; for in some
cases where this differs inadvertently from the Basle text the Leiden
edition reproduces the mistakes.³⁷ But this is not always so; for
sometimes the Leiden text reverts from a change (not manifestly an
error) made by the London editor to the reading of the authorized
editions ⁸⁸.

'Phe arrangement of the letters, however, was done superficially.
The dates assigned in the preceding editions were accepted almost
without question, and the letters placed accordingly; those which
too obviously conflicted with Erasmus’ movements as shown by
other letters being deferred to the Appendix, which was swelled by
the inclusion of the Deventer letter-book and other late-gathered
contributione ³⁹. In consequence, for the years up to 1517, during
which the Basle folio was a false guide‚ the Leiden arrangement is
not of much more value than that of its original. ·For two hundred

{eagalhoweven it has remained the standard edition of Erasmus’
p ae.
