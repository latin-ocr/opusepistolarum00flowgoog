[It has been assumed by all the biographers of Erasmus that this letter was
written after his departure from Rome. This Implies either that Erasmus, who
was certainly in Rome after receiving the offer from England (cf. Lond. xxvi. 34,
LB. 1175), paid no visit to Piso before his departure and only wrote to inform
him of the step lie had taken, or else that Piso was absent from Rome when
Erasmus left and returned to find hIm gone, of which there is not the least

> indication in this letter. A more probable explanation is that it was written
when Erasmus was still absent from Rome on his journey ιο Naples with
Alexander Stewart‚ a journey for which the principal evidence is in iv. aro-3, sup·
plemented by Adaq. 3714 and 4120. and Lond. iii. 44, LB. ⁹33, and LB. App. 171,
and the duration of which is not specified. The third paragraph of this lether
implies that Erasmus had not yet made up his mind to accept Lord Mountjoy's
offer3 since Piso would not have been hesitating what advice to give if Erasmus
had already started for England. Post to absentem (l. 21) also suggests that
Erasmus had left Rome for a time and was expected to return ; not that he had
taken his departure. Indeed, throughout the letter there is no note of farewell.
It is noticeable further that Piso speaks of answering ‘serius' a letter from
Erasmus received ‘ iampridem? As Ep. 215 is dated 27 May, there cannot have
been a long interval between its arrival in Rome and the writing of this letter.
· The following may therefore be taken as the ch ronology of Erasmus· movements
mssffiffin· First visit ιο Rome from Siena (de Nolhac, p. 64).
Apul. Second visit to Rome, where he can be traced on 6 apr.. (ὶοοᾶ
. . Friday (Ciceronianus ε LB. i. 993 Α), and 30 apr. (EP· 2¹5· 2⁸)-

July init. He returns to Rome and hastens on to England.

He can be traced at Bologna (AB. 76, which must be placed before 28 Sept.
because of another letter of that date announcing the arrival of Carteromachus.
Fantuzzl, Seria. Bozoqn„ ii. 281), and his route then lay over the Spliigen to Ghur,
Constance, strasburg, and so down the Rhine to Antwerp (iv. 216 seq.)2 md
after aylsit to Louvain (cf. Ep. 266) he crossed to England.

The importance of this correction of Erasmus' movements lies in its bearing
on the date assigned to Ep. 222.

dafnes Piso or Borsody (1- March 1527), a native of Medgyes, in the Hungarian
province of Transylvania‚ and at this time Hungarian ambassador in Rome.
He is probably to be traced in Rome as early as 1507 (AB. 63). Erasmus plainly
made his acquaintance on his first visit to Rome in Feb. 1509, since it was to
Siena that he sent the MS. book of Erasmus' letters, which he had discovered
(Lond. 1· 1, LB. 507). ln the autumn of 1513 he was sent by Leo x to attempt
