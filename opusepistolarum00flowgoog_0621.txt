ERASMUS’ EARLY LIFE 583

Brethren of the Common Life. Here they remained for between
two and three years ⁴⁰, and then returned ⁴⁷ to Gouda. The letter
to Rome in two passages⁴3 represents Erasmus as being just fifteen
at the time3 the figure cannot possibly be right, but the double
reference to his birthday probably indicates correctly the season
of the year. When the boys returned the guardians renewed their
efforts to persuade them to the monastic life. Peter soon gave way,
but Erasmus held out for a while longer. Then followed the period
of dejection, the chance meeting with Cornelius of Woerden, the
first acquaintance with Steyn and the decision to enter it on trial.
The probation lasted one year or perhaps two ⁴⁹, and at the end of
that time Erasmus took on himself the vows of an Augustinian canon
in the priory of Steyn.

This house had been founded in 1419 by James, son of Gyrard
who became its first prior, on lands in the district of Steyn given by
John, Bastard of Blois. It was situated in the parish of Haastrecht,
but on the other side of the Yssel, and within a mile of Gouda; and
thus though dedicated to st. Gregory ⁸⁰, from its neamess to Gouda
it was known as Emmaus. Its statutes were modelled on those
of the Chapter of Windesheim‚ a congregation which, headed by
the Augustinian convent of Windesheim near Zwolle and com·
prising nearly a hundred houses of both sexes, had adopted a
uniform and more rigorous rule than was observed in most Augus·
tinian monasterie& But it did not belong to that congregation, for

a separate Chapter with Sion at its head, into which other neighbour-
ing convente of both sexes were afterwards received. At the time
of Erasmus' entry Steyn was under the direction of John, son of
Christian, its fifth prior. On 16 J uly 1549 the monastery was ·
burned to the ground and the monks were shortly afterwards located
in Gouda by the Town Council‚ which had acquired the lordship of
the lande of Steyn. The site of the priory is now occupied by a
farmhouse known as ‘het Klooster ⁶¹.’

The date of the entry into Steyn must be placed as early as
possible to accommodate Reyner Snoy’s statement δ’ that Erasmus and
Wm. Herman were nearly ten years together there. If Erasmus left
Deventer in 1484, he cannot have entered Steyn before 1487—a date
