28 October (1507).

[The year 1507 was spent by Erasmus with his pupils at Bologna, and during
tlus time the Adaqia were enlarged from &iudanon into maiades, the title which
is henceforward applied to them. At the conclusion of the year for which he
had bound himself he contemplated returning to the north, but before going
he wished to reprint the translations from Euripides (cf. Ep. 188) as a suitable
volume for presentation to his friendS. The famous Aldine prees, founded in
1494, was now somewhat in eclipse. Its head, Aldus Manutius (1449-6 Feb.
1515), of Bassiano near Velletri, or, as he later styled himself, of Rome, had been
thrown into prison in the wars which ravaged Italy from 1505-7, and had lost
most of his possessions. No books issued from it in 1506, and none in 1507,
except this volume for which Erasmus now arranged. Under these circumstances
it was something of a venture for Aldus to accept the work of an author still
only slightly known to fame, as the first production of his restored press. The
connexion once established he hastened to secure the services of Erasmus, who
was thus detained in Italy for more than a year longer than he had intended.

This letter and Epp. 209, 212, 3 were discovered by M. de Nolhac, and are printed
with a facsimile in his Eram en Italis (and edit. 1898); they are the earliest
known specimens of Erasmus’ handwriting. 'l'he date of this is given by a note
in Aldus· hand on the back ε ‘ Erasmus Roterodamus. Ex Bononia v Kal.
Nouer'nbr. 1507! It is confirmed by the publication of the Euripides in Dec.
1507.

Anno MANVTIO Romano ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS S. P. D.

Imvn apud me saepe numero optaui, doctissime Manuti‚ vt
quantum lucis attulisses vtrique litteraturae, non solum arte tua
formulisque longe nitidissimis, verum etiam ingenio doctrinaque
neutiquam triuiali, tantundem emolumenti illa tibi vicissim rettulis-
set. Nam quantum ad famam attinet, dubium non est quin in 5
omnem vsque posteritatem Aldus Manutius volitaturus sit per
omnium ora, quicunque litterarum sacris sunt initiati. Erit autem
memoria tua, quemadmodum nunc est fama, non illustris modo sed
fauorabilis quoque et amanda, propterea quod (vt audio) restituendis
propagandisque bonis authoribus das operam, summa quidem cura, ιο
at non pari lucro, planeque Herculis exemplo laboribus excerceris,
pulcherrimis quidem illis et immortalem gloriam allaturis aliquando,
verum aliis interim frugiferis magis quam tibi. Audio Platonem
Graecanicis abs te formulis excudi, quem docti plaerique iam
vehementer expectant. Quos authores medicinae impresseris cupio ¹5
cognoscere. Atque vtinam Paulum Aeginitam nobis dones. Demiror
