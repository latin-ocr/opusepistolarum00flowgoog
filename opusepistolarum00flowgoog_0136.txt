LETTERS OF ERASMUS

· [1489

omnium propemodum vatum testantur carmina. At nunc, si vltra
tercentum aut ducentos annos caelaturas, picturas, sculpturas, aedi-
ficia, fabricas et omnium denique officiorum monimenta inspicias,
puto et admiraberis et ridebis nimiam artificum rusticitatem, cum

85 nostro rursus aeuo nihil sit artis quod non opificum effinxerit in-

dustria· Haud aliter quoque priscis saeculis cum omnium artium,
tum praecipue eloquentiae studia apprime floruisse constat; atque
inde rursus barbarorum increscente pertinacia ita euanuisse vt ne
vestigium reliquum videre fuerit. Tam coepere illiteratissimi quique,

90 qui nunquam didicere, docere quod nesciebant; docere, inquam,

magna mercede nil scire, stultiores reddentes discipulos quam acce·
perant, imo et eo redigentes vt se ipsos quoque nescirent. Tum a
tergo reiectis veterum praeceptionibus itum est ad recentia quaedam
imperitiae praecepta, puta modos significandi, verbom commenta, et

95 ad ridiculas grammaticae disciplinae regulas deliramentaque innu-

mera. Et cum iam omnia summo sudore perdidicerant, in id literarum
eloquentiaeque conscenderant fastigium vt ne vnam quidem orationem
Latine proferre nouerint. Et sane, quantum mihi videre videor, si
id barbarum hominum genus eo quo coeperat cursu perrexisset, nescio

100 in quam nouam sermonis speciem nostram Thaliam vertissent. Sed

eam tum noster Laurentius, tum Philelphus iam propemodum ex·
tinctam >admiranda eruditionis praestantia ab interitu vindicarunt.

Quo contenderit studio Laurentius, vt et barbarorum refelleret
ineptias et iamdiu obliuionis situ obductas oratorum poetarumque

105 obseruantias in medium reduceret, illius te docebunt libri quos

Elegantias vocant. Quos si, quod quidem suspicor, iam legisti, non

1ο6. Elegantias] A treatise on Latin
grammar, which begins with simple
accidence and then illustr-ates the
usage of words. Frequent editions of
it were printed from 1471 onwards;
and on two occasions Erasmus made
9 ‘paraphrase’ of it, reducing the
latter part to the form of a dictionary
by arranging the words in alphabetical

28 Jan. 1539, appended to a translation
of Xenophon's Hiero (Basle, Froben,

of 1531. At an age which he variously
describes as about eighteen and
scarcely twenty, he was asked by a
man, who had recently opened a school,
to advice him as to the best author
from whom to teach his boys Latin 3
and on recommending Valla's Eceqantiae
119 was pressed, and consented, to make
an ‘ epitome,’ which he handed to the

schoolmaster without keeping 9 copy.
Besides the statements as to his age
he says in the letter to Gilles that the
epitome was made in Holland seven
years before he went to Paris (1488 9).

subsequently in Paris, at a date
which he describes in 1531 as thirty—
five years ago, he wrote a much fuller
paraphrase for an English pupil of
whose intelligence he had not much
opinion; probably Robert Fisher, who
is spoken of with similar dispar-age-
ment in connexion with the De comit.

posed about the same time (Epp. so,

sequently took of his Paraphrase 999
