608 APPENDIX VIII

consideration of the circumstances under which the letter-book came
into being. The boys who wrote it were not advanced scholare, and

doubtless were often in a hurry to get their irksome task finished; ·

of the letters which they copied, too, some at least must have been

crabbed and hard to decipher. It is not surprising, therefore, that

in addition to the common faults of copying a number of impossible

words and unreadable sentences are found, which invite correction

by an editor ; and the character of the copyists needs to be continually

ἕψε in mind in criticizing the text of letters which emanate from
1s source.

Leclerc says in his preface that the Deventer letter-book supplied
him with 322 unpublished letters. · Το the 304 mentioned above

romain to be accounted for, which he found in the book, but which
are now lost. They covered some of the missing leaves, including
ff. 225-236 and 239, and 9 of them were autographs. From
the composition of the Appendix it is possible to trace them with
some degree of certainty.

Of the 517 letters which it contains 304 come, as we have seen,
from the Deventer book; 1 18 were already printed in the London
edition, but had been omitted· by Leclerc from the body of his work
because their dates would not accord with his arrangement 3 1, which
had escaped the London editor ¹⁸, he found in the Basle folio of 1541
(N ⁸); and 43 more are in the Codex Rehdigermus, 254, of the Town
Library at Breslau ¹⁶. Out of the remaining 51, 19 are so directly
concerned with Erasmus’ Gouda friends ¹⁷ that they probably formed
a separate collection placed in Leclerc’s hands by one of the persons
mentioned in his preface3 and from the prominent part occupied by
William Herman ¹⁸ it would seem as though the collector had chonen
out letters addressed or relating to Erasmus from a letter-book
belonging originally to Herman.

Some such collection as this was sold in April 1705 among the
books of Peter Francius, late Professor of History at Amsterdmg.
