ohn Becar os Borsselen was evidently a kinsman of the Lady of Veere (p. 208),
and perhaps made Erasmus' acquaintance during the latter’s residence at Tourne-
hem. He was an eager student, and family pati-onage enabled him to gratify his
desire sor learning; but a large part of his lire was spent ιιι teaching, for which
he had not much tacte. Mter receiving a Canonry at Middelburg in 1513, he
became tutor to Cornelius Erdorf‚ a nephew of the Busleidens at Luxemburg,
in 1515, and accompanied him to Louvain in 1516. There he enjoyed the society
os Erasmus ιιι the College du Lis, and was recommended by him to the patronage
of the Bp. of Utrecht. He was proposed as the first Professor of Latin in the
new Collegium Trilingue, but declined on being appointed Dean of the college
os Sandenburch, st Veere (van Heussen, ii. Middel burg, 27)· Shortly afterwards
he became tutor to Maximilian of Burgundy, with whom he went once more to
Iaouvain in 1522. Besides his existing preserment he was elected Dean of
Middelburg ιιι 1521, but through court ο pposit10n was unable to secure the post3
but he received from Adol phua of B undy the living of Brouwershaven near
Zierikzee, vacant through the deathm} Nicholas of Burgundy (Ep. ¹44) ιιι 1522
(cf. van Heussen, ii. Middelburg. 70). He was still at Louvain in 1528. Two of
Geldenhauer's Saturae, Louvain, Th. uertens, 13 June 1515, are addressed to him;
there is a letter to him in the second edition os Hadr. Barland' s De Hellandiae
principibus, Antwerp, Η. Hillen,Jan. 1520? and he is mentioned in the Epima-
lamium Petri Δορίἀίἰ (LB. i. 749 Α) as one of the lights of Iaouvain.

Accsm estate proxima ternas a te litterae, postremae autem
abhinc sex menses per dominum Ioannem Sixtinum, cui comes
erat Augustinus Aggeus; qui praeter ea quae tu scripsisti, multa
mihi de tuis studiis omnique rerum tuarum statu narrabant.
Genabamus enim vna, et postridie erant pransuri mecum, nisi 5
prius hinc soluissent in Phrysiam nauigaturi. Eos aliquanto
post operiebar hac ad te redituros (id enim ita futurum promise-
rant), eramque iis daturus ad te litterae. At vbi aliquot mensibus
frustra expectassem eos neque aliam inuestigassem scribendi ad
te oportunitatem, seuiente post compluribus mensibus hyeme ιο
vehementissima, factum est vt nihil adhuc tibi rescripserim.
Quare nunc vel tandem nactus quendam qui ad Decanum Sancti
Pauli Londinensis proficiscebatur, quanquam nesciebam quo te
loco meae litterae conuenire possint, sperabam tamen opera et
eura Decani eas facile tibi redditum iri. Nolui itaque omittere 15
