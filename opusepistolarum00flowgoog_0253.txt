³498] 'ro WILLIAM HERMAN 221,

1489 he was admitted to lecture publicly in the University. On 1 Oct. 1490
his first book was published in Paris, an edition of the Liuia considerably
amplifled. In Sept. 1491 finding his position in Paris unsatisfactory he went
{or some months to Poitiers and Toulouse3 but returned unsuceessful in 1492,
and took part in the quarrels which expelled Balbus from Paris. On 3 Apr.
1494 he published his Παρία addremd to an Englishman‚ Thoe. Ward (Gairdner‚
Laura eslim VII, 11), through whom he perhaps hoped to find employment in
England‚ like Cornelius Vitellius and Bernard Andreas. His position in Paris
was precarious 'until he won the favour 01 chae. vm with a poem de Neapolitana
victoria and was made royal poet in ¹⁴9⁶· This title appears first in his De
Neapolitana Pomorum-eiquo victoria, 31 Aug. 1496 ; but is lacking in his Do Injluentia
Silda-tam, 10 May. He justified his appointment by a succession of poema on
court subjecte, and c. 1505 received a canoni-y at Bayeux, which he held until
his death. nis lecturos in Paris were clever and attracted large audiences‚ but
were marked by great laxity of morals (Lond. xxi. 20, LB. 4893 cf. iv, 72-5). He
nevertheleoe retained the pati-onage of many eminent persons and enjoyed the
esteem of such men as Gaguin and the two Femands. He was one of Erasmus*
first friends in Paris, and in spite of diversity of character the tie formed was
lasting. Besides his court poetry he wrote Epistulae paroemiam ac morales and
a poem Do malibus {accumulavimus vimctibus. 'I'he first edition of Erasmus'
adoaia contains a commendatory letter by him (Ep. 127).

FAVSTVS Pol-:TA levs GVILIELMO SVO S.

Cvx mecum ipoe cogito, mi Guiliehne, quanta sit Erasmi nostri
tum doctrina tum vita ab omnibus certe vitiis aliena, non possum
profecto, non possum, inquam, non laetari, quod eum scilicet Virmn
nacta sit religio tua, quem non solum vos ipsi, verum etiam Parisiense
hoc Gymnasium amare, colere, obseruare, admiratique debeat. Quid 5
enim melius, quid praestantius, quid denique diuinius, quam virum
candidis et litteris et moribus nitentem reperiri, hac videlicet tem·
pestate, quae quidem ita ignaua, ita corrupta, ita exsecrabilis est, vt
Sardanapalicas potius voluptates quam Socraticas vel virtutes vel
mores imitetur? Neque hoc adulationi meae adscribendum esse 10
censeas velim, quandoquidem a derisoria et subdola assentatione
semper alienus fuerim. Neque vel ad te vel ad alium scriberem,
nisi is esset Erasmus, quc, vt cum stomacho, nec paruo quidem,
loquar, tua non solum religio verum etiam patria indigna esset.

[The date given in the text is impossible, as Erasmus was then in England.
The letter is evidently written after a visit to Helland. 'rho names, which do
not occur elsewhere in Erasmus· correspondence, afford no clue. 1 place it con-
joam-any with Ep. 83, because of the mouth-date]
