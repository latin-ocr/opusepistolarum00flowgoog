[The date of this 01111 ΕΡ. 996 010 established from ΕΡ. 998, which is plainly
written to thank for the wine asked for in Ep. 996.

When Erasmus left Paris in June (Ep. 956. 99 11.), 110 expected to stay for some
time at Hammes Castle with Lord Mountjoy (ΕΡ. 959. 11, 9); but being dis·
appointed in this, perhaps because his patron was expecting to return shortly to
England (cf. Ep. 931. 7 n.), he passed 011 to London. There he seemsto have fallen
ill with the sweating sickness (Epp. 996. 3 and 937. 56), Ρο111οΡ0 111 Grocin's
house (ΕΡ. 941. 93 11.) 3 and the attack was 00 serious that rumoum of his death
were circulated (E p. 944 Α 01111 951). 011 recovering he went down to Cambridge,
perhaps at Fishe s suggestion, and returned to the college in which he had
formerly lodged (App. 6) 3 though Fisher had resigned the Presidency 111 1508.]
