Sex-vatius.

Amongst individuals‚ in addition to those already mentioned,
my thanks are due primarily to Mr. Ingram Bywater, Regius
Professor of Greek in this University, who has given me most
generous support and guidance‚ and who in reading through
all my proofs has allowed me to profit continually by his
large store of learning3 to ΜΓ. Robinson Ellis, Corpus Professor
of Latin, who has frequently aided me in tracing quotations

to the memory of my friend J oseph Gany, the devoted curator
of Beatus Rhenanus’ library at Schlettstadt, who on many
visits was unsparing of his time in laying its treasures before
me, and of his palaeographical skill in aiding me to interpret
them. Dr. Bernoulli, Librarian of the University Library
at Basle, has been most courteous in enabling me to explere
the splendid store of Erasmiana and Amerbaohiana under
