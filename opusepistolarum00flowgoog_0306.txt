fuisse satisfactum; et nullam esse ex omni studiorum genere partem

nimium puerilia, dicendi genera in singulis epistolarum generibus
ferendum erat quod odiose inculcat, ni id et imperite faceret, qui
eam grauissimam epistolam iudicarit, quae verbosissime eaeet et
quam maxime alieno repetita principio. Τιιιιι in ipso operis limine

40 quorsum attinuit rhetorices praecepta toties perscripta repetere? An
