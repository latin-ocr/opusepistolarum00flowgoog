when Erasmus was corresponding with Boetius.

Arnold Eusebius or Boetius (c.1450-†4 Apr. 1499), a carmelite of Gh'ent,
of whom little is known. He was the friend of most of the literary men of his

to write and publish3 and he appears in this light ιιι the correspondenee of
eharles Fernand, Gaguin, Trithemius, and Cornelius Aurelius (Molhuysen, αΔ.
