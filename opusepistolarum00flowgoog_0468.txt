supervision of the Prinee’s studies ιο which he was appointed by Henry vu

Erasmus ιο return to England as one of the first acts of the new reign (Ep. 215).
Erasmus’ letter is plainly of the same date as Ep. 2053 the statement that it was
written st Venice is almost certainly an error. The fragment which follows
was recalled by him from memory.]

Francis 1 in 1515. His love of learning led him to use his wealth for its

founding a Colloqium ffllinque at Louvain, which, like Co us Christi college
in Oxford (p. 416), should be the special home of the ew Learning. In
promoting the execution of this will Erasmus played a very active part.
