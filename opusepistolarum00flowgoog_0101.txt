Vita Erasini p. 161. (Gouda.)
Lond. xxxi. 4: LB. App. 506. (1484 fin.)

[This letter is possibly thet mentioned in Lond. xxiv. 5, ΕΒ. App. 442, as
written to winckel by Erasmus in his fourteenth year. It seems to refer
to the time of guardianship, snd to the boys' anxiety about their father's
property; end es such, Winckel may well heve been nettled at reeeiving it,
especially if the property was not well secured. The incident is more fully
narrated in the Do oonxrib. Epist. (LB. i. 347 Ε). 111 eopying thet passage in the
Gouds. HS. 1324, f. 108v· (see App. 9) Hand A adds in the margin: ‘Erat
magister Petrus Winekel.'

Erasmus’ estimato of his own age does not aoeord with 1466 as the year of his
· birth (see App. 2) ; but the letter may be placed with considerable probability
aster the return from novantem]
