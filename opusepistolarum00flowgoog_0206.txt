Besides Erasmus' relations with Augustine's Liibeck pupils (Ep. 54), in the
early part of 1497 he was engaged in teaching two Englishmem Thomas Grey
and Robert Fisher (Ep. 62), who were living in the sanw house with him under
the care of a Scotch guardian. After a time the guardian seems to have grown
suspicious of Erasmus' feelings towards Grey (there is some resemblance in
tone between the letters to Servatius, App. 3, and those to Grey) and mquested
him to leave. He complied, though in some distreus, and betook himself to
Augustine‚ whence he revenged himself by writing abusive letters about the
Scotchman. Epp. 58-60 are evidently about the same date as Ep. 61.

The identity of Grey has not been determined. He was clearly of good
family, but as he cannot be traced in the pedigrees of the house of Grey, the
obscure allusion in 11. 3, 4 possibly indicates that he was a bastard. His
friendship with Erasmus was not intermpted by the present disturbance but
lasted throughout his life. He was perhaps in London in 1511 Ep. ποι fin.).
In 1516 he was living in Paris, having by that time married, an was in close
friendship with Peter Viterius (Ep. 66). At the same time he seems to have
had some connexion with Cambridge (LB. App. 263 and 280). In 1518 he
visited Erasmus at Louvain and obtained from him an introduction to More,
to help him in an attempt to recover some landed property in England‚ which
was then in Colet's hands (LB. App. 311). In Oct. 1525 he was staying at Basle
with Erasmus (Lond. xviii. 11 ; LB. 790). Lond. xxx. 16, LB. 576 is perhaps a
note written at the conclusion of this visit. Erasmus’ letter to the nuns of
Denny, first printed in 1528, was written at Grey's request.

'Phe guardian is variously described as ⁸ semi-Scotus ’ (Ep. 61. 192) and ‘Scoto-
rum Scotissimus ' (Siberoh's edit. of Do σωιοαϊὸ. Epist. fo, ⁶6). He was a man of
