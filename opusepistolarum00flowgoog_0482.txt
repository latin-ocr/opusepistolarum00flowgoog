who was studying in Italy. He met
Erasmus first at Venice, where he was
servant-pupil to John hscsri83 an
opportunity which enabled him to
secure the insertion of one Latin and
two Greek epigrams into the Aldine
Adayia (Ep. 011). From Venice he
went on to Padus, where he was a
pupil 01¹ Musurus5 and afterwards to
,Rome (EE. 140). After leavIng Italy
he entered the service, first 01 Louis
of Amboise, Cardinal Bp. of Albi, from
whom he received the Archdeaconry
of Albi; and afterwards of John de
Ganay, Chaucellor of France. On
de Ganay's death (27 May 1512) he
addressed to the Queen, Anne of
Brittsny, a poem on the burning 01¹
⁴ the great carrick of Brest' (see Brewer,
i. 3388) by the English on 1o Aug. 1512
and the heroisin of its commander,
Herveus Portimoger ; which won him
the appointment of Secretary to the
Queen. 'Phe poem was immediately
published as choraiqerae nauis connum-atio
by Badius, 13 Jan. 15133 and More,
taking exception to the language used
in it about the English, wrote a string
of epigrams in reply. When these
were published by Froben in March
1518, Brixius in great indignation
composed a poem, Antimamaes, which
111 s ite
publilihed in the winter of 1519. More’s
lengthy replies, addressed to Brixius
and to Erasmus, concluded the con-
troversy; but some years elapsed before
the quarrel was composed. Brixius
had by that time attained to wealth
and position, being Canon of Notre
Dame in Paris and Almoner to Francis 1.
He bought an estate at Gentilly for the
entertainment of his friends ; smongst
whom was his old master, Laeca-is,
when he came to Paris in 1526. In

of Erasmus' entreaties he ,

his later years Brixius worked at
Chrysostom and translated some of his
writings. His last controversy wss
with Erasmus, whom he attached, more
amicably, on the relative positions
assigned to Budaeus and Badius in
the ciceronianus (Basle, Froben, March
1528). See NBG.

2. Francisoum] Tol-rosanus of Asola
(0. 1481—NoV. 1546), 01ἀοοι 0011 of
Andr. Torresanus (υ. infra). After the
death of Aldus he assisted his father
in conducting the press, and wrote
a large number of prefaces for the
books published. On his father's death
a quarrel ensued between Francis with
his brotherFrederic and their nephews,
Aldus· sons 3 and, until it was settled,
the press remained idle. In 1533 the
two parties united and published books
as the heire of Aldus and Torresanus5
but they separated again in 1540. The
last book bearing Francis· name is
dated July 1544. See Bernoni, Dei
Tor-rasam, Blado e Raqaaeoni ; and
Renouard.

5. Andreas] Torresanus of Asola
(4 March 1451—15 March 1529), Aldus’
iather-in·law and partner. He began
to print at Venice in 14793 and in 1482
his presa gained distinction by the
acquisition of Jenson's type. In 1503
110 assisted Aldus to publish Orige
and in 1505 (AE. p. ¹7) Aldus marri
his daughter. When the wars of
1506—7 involved Aldus in difficulties
(p. 437), Ἔστι-00011110 came to his assis·
tanco, and the two presses were —united
in 1508, ι11011 first book, Pliny's Letters‚
being published in Nor. 1508. After
Aldus’ death Torresanus carried on the
press with his sons until 1509.ν See
