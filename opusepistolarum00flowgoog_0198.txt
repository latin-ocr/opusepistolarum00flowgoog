[This and ΕΡ. 73 are preserved in the Bibliotheque de Ste. Genevieve at Paris.
The volume· containing them are xvii⁰ copies ef documents relating to Kauburn
and his reforma. Each item is copied twice, this letter being in vol. 618,
p. 1096 (a), which 1 follow here3 and vol. 619, Ρ. 369 (B).'1'he copyist adds
that Erasmus was 30 at the time of writing. The date is fixed by the reference
to the De casa numida, and confirmed by Erasmus' business (Ep pp. 50, ι) on
recovery from illness (ΕΡΡ. 50, 1) and by the description ome. Bet-man (ΕΡ. 50).

'l'he hesdinge given in GC„ aser-ibing the two letters to the Livry reforma, are
not found in the MSS.

John Mauburn († 99 Dec. 1501) was born at Bruasels and educated at Utrecht,
where he became‘ musicae cantor’ in the cathedral. He entered the mo
of Mount St. Agnes near Zwolle as an Augustinian canon, and ra pidly became
distinguished in the reformed windesheim congregation. At Zwolle he wrote
a Boeotum maiorm spir-imus, which was printed in ι49ι (Hain ι3994).
Ιιι ι495 being still young he was ‘socius confessoris Monialium' at Campen.
On 95 Sept. &4 496) he arrived in Paris as the leader of a commission from the
Chap ter of indesheim (Ρ. 905) invited by the Ab'bot of St. Severinus' at
Chateau- Landon, near Fontainebleau, to introduce reformes 'I'he Abbey was
made the headn' of a new congregation modelled on windesheim, Hauburn
being for a time Prion-3 and the success of his reforms there led to the invitation
to the party in which Cornelius Gerard came to Paris in 1497 (Ρ. 905). The
chief mover in this, Nic. de Hacqueville, also induced unuh urn to undet-take
the reform of the Abbey of Livry,a afew miles NE.. of Paris, about 1498.
Mauburn persuaded the Abba-designate, John, Abp. of Tarsus in Cilicia, to
sui-render the Abbey to de Hacqueville for the introduction of the proposed
reforms3 and when these had been carried out, Mauburn succeeded de
Hacqueville as Abbot (9 Apr. 1501) until his death, which occurred in Paris under
the care of John Standonck of Montaigu. Faber stapulensis speaks of himself
