[Probably 1513 from the frequent mention of the horse in the 1611616 to 6011611

William 6011611 <·Ι·68 Aug. 1566) of Landbeach, a village five miles NB. of
Cambridge. The person of this name who was BA. at Cambridge in 1484-5,
Μ.Α. 1488, was perhaps his father, since Erasmus describes 11116 6611611 66
‘iuuenis' in Ep. 679. 16. He seems at this period to have been residing at
Landbeach with his parents and, ir Epp. 675, 6 616 rightly attributed. to have
been in charge of 6 6611001 ; cf. Ep. 696. 5 11. He did copying work for Erasmus,
and also from time to time took charge of his horse during Erasmus· visits to
London. Subseqoently he became tutor to Hore's children, and was there in
1517, when on 6 Sept. 116 received the living of Conington 11661· Landbeach
(Stapleton. Tres meue, Vita Hori, p. 664, where a letter to him from More about
a course of study is printed3 and Brewer, ii. App. 17) ς 11111 11 appears that he
did not at once leave uore's service, and before settling at Conington 116 16 said
to have been for a time in Wolsey’s household. See W. K. Clay's Hm. Q! Land-
boeot· (1861), p. 323 Athen. Gmuab„ i. 94 and 5373 might, 177-93 and DNB.

When the plague broke out in Cambridge, Erasmus retlred into the country,
very probably to Gonell at Landbeach. Ep. 675 shows him just returned to
Cambridge, and hesitating to stay ς 111 Ep. 676 116 1166 decided to Β] again 10 1116
country, whence Ep. 678 (11. 66-3) 16 written.

Ascham, who went to Cambridge in 1536, heard from 661161 (cf. p. 495) 6
tradition still surviving of Erasmus and 1116 110166, ‘which when he had ben
sore at bis boke, for lacke of better exercise wolde take his 116166 and ryde about
the Harkette niu and come agayne.' Tamphilus, ed. Arbor, p. 46. It was perhaps
on one of these occasions that he had the fall with 1116 116166 down a high dyke,
which 16 described 66 occurring in England‚ in 6 letter to Pirckheimer, 14 March
1565, prefixed to an edition of aemmwmi Dialoqi sex, Basle‚ Froben, May 1565.]
