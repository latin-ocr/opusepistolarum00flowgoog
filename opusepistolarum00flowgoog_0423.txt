Passa, mi Roberte, in instituto omnium (meo quidem ν iudicio)
pulcherrimo superisque gratissimo, vt iuuentutem Gandauorum puro
Latinae linguae sermone pares ad optimas disciplinas percipiendas. -
Liuidorum blateramenta non magis animum tuum permoneant

et miror et doleo, qui ita repente nos reliqueris. Doluit maiorem

diesque paro quaedam in Principis aduentum. Mittam ad te breui
quedam quibus ipse fateberis tuum munus abunde fuisse com-
pensatum. ‚

Bene vale, mi Roberte iucundissime, et tuum Erasmum sic ama

vt ab eo diligeris ς diligeris autem plurimum. ι5
