suadet vt apud Abbatem potius verser, 11 commode queam 3 Medicus
contra vt apud Adrianum. Vterque facit, opinor, quod canes solent, 5
qui socium in culina nullum amant. De Gardiano an per omnia
syncerae futurus 111 subhaeeito3 nam subarrogantem esse sentio.
Neque de Adriano vnquam verbum apud te fecit, cum per illum
res haec potius confici debuerit. Nos quicunque erit exitus magno
animo excipiemuS. 10
Tu cura vt 111011, mi Batte. Mitte vt primum commoditas dabitur,
nostra omnia nostrosque Dialogos omnes, si libeat forte perficere.
Ludouico insta, vt quantum potest omnes meas epistolas transscribat.

Vale.
